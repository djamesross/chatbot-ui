Hi Darryl,
I'm was happy you were able to see the girls on Sunday and spend time with
your family, especially after these past few distressing weeks. It gave me
comfort that we could agree that you would not drink while they were in
your care, you would be with family and that the girls would sleep at my
place. Charlotte and Alice love you and I know it's important that they
spend time with you and all of your family.

However, I am furious that you had the girls *alone *in your care on Sunday
as I was under the impression Todd would be dropping the girls off at 6:30
pm at my place after spending time at Cindy's party. It was only at 6:40 pm
when I texted you to confirm if you were on your way that you confirmed
that they were at your place. Immediately I rushed over. I feel that you
were not being honest with me and clearly taking advantage of the
situation. I suspect you told a different story to your family too. I don't
like involving Todd and Cindy either but unfortunately, I don't trust you
and I feel that you are being dishonest. Clearly, you and I have major
communication issues.

As I've stated the girls' safety and well-being is my number one concern
and I don't feel that you can properly care for them right now. I would
like the girls to see you but only with family present.

Todd/Cindy-sorry to involve you, feel free to block me if this is too much.
I want to make sure you are aware of my position about Darryl to spend time
with the girls, which hasn't changed. If Darryl is not getting any help to
address his addictions issues I am not comfortable with the girls alone in
his care.

Cynthia
