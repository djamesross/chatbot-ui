We're really glad that you're trying to learn more about Ben's =
diagnosis, and the treatment options. But we aren't comfortable =
withholding treatment because you have to catch up. Ben's new teacher =
has already expressed concern, and warned that Ben will fall behind if =
things continue as they are. We're happy to work with you, and remain =
open to discussion, but at this point you haven't provided any =
legitimate reason to delay treatment further.

The treatment has to be chosen in Ben's best interest, based on =
professional judgmental, research, and our family situations. Given all =
those factors, starting Ben on medication and beginning behavioural =
treatment is the best option. We've decided on this route for the =
following reasons:
- medication is a first-line treatment, it is widely prescribed, and is =
safe and effective. While you have expressed general fears, we have not =
received a reasonable explanation for avoiding it.
- behavioural treatment alone is a viable treatment option, but it takes =
longer, is not as effective, and depends on us doing it right to work
- medication can bring benefits within days, as opposed to weeks or =
months
- the best outcomes are reached when medication and behavioural =
treatment are combined
- using the two together can lead to lower doses of medication and less =
counselling, making treatment easier for everyone involved

We are making this decision because we are responsible for primary care, =
are most familiar with Ben's education, symptoms, with his diagnosis, =
and with the treatment options. We feel that waiting longer because of =
personal feelings, or for you to catch-up, is not in the best interest =
of Ben's education and well-being. We know that your preference is to =
use avoid medication, but we don't think that opinion is fully informed, =
and it does not take into account the fact that implementing, monitoring =
and adjusting treatment will be primarily our responsibility, in the =
context of our family situation.

When you have had a chance to speak to Ben's grade 3 teacher, his new =
teacher, as well as his doctor and psychologist, we will still be open =
to discussion. Beginning medication does not constitute a permanent =
treatment decision. It can be stopped at any point, and is not required =
when he is with you.

In the meantime, here are some ways you can help limit or reduce =
symptoms, which could mean a lower dose of medication:
- An unhealthy diet may worsen the symptoms. Limiting the amount of =
sugar and junk food he eats is helpful
- Staying up late and irregular hours make symptoms of ADHD worse. =
Sleeping in does not make-up for late nights. We notice that it takes =
3-4 days for the boys to get back into a routine after spending weekends =
away. It would be helpful for the boys if we kept a regular bedtime at =
8-8:30 pm.
- Encouraging physical exercise is helpful
- Television, movies and video games should be limited to 2 hours/day or =
less (http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/physical-activity-guidelines)

Keep us up to date as you learn more. We'll send you documents and =
information about behavioural treatments as we receive them.
