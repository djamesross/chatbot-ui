Hi Darryl,

Sorry my message did not go through yesterday.

As covid cases are on the rise and Alice was exhibiting symptoms and had
been exposed, it was best that we isolate until we got a few
negative tests. Unfortunately for illnesses, we will have to postpone until
we can confirm it is not Covid. As I understand you did speak to Alice over
FT on Tuesday and had an hour of FT with Charlotte.  Alice spent the whole
day in bed Tuesday,  she has tested 3x negative so we are in the clear and
she is feeling better today and they are expecting to see you and your
mother.

I work full time outside of the home three days a week and  the girls are
 available for visits in the summer as follows:
Tuesdays in person 5-8 pm ( I can only leave work at the earliest 4 pm).
Sunday 2-6 pm in person (this was previously agreed upon)
Saturdays  FT 10 am (30 mins)
Thursdays FT-  6pm (30 mins)

I will continue to drive and pick up the girls at this time.

If your mother is not available for rescheduling or if the timetable does
not work, we should have a backup just in case. I am looking into this.

As for pick up, please have the girls ready at the front yard for the
agreed pick up time, your mother is the supervisor and should be able to
make sure the girls are ready to be picked up at the agreed upon time. This
past Sunday, I waited for 10 minutes after texting her and then had to wait
another ten minutes while you said goodbye. If this continues to be an
issue, please have your lawyer or yourself speak to your mom about the
expectations as a supervisor so that there is less stress on everyone at
drop off. We want to keep this as healthy and positive for the girls.

I will drop off girls today at 5 pm.

Cynthia
