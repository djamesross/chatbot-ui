Hi Any,

Before she took the girls I was starting to plan a separation, and was =
concerned about getting sole custody of the girls. If it=92s determined =
based on the best interests of the children, I thought it might make a =
strong case to say that no single parent should be left with all four =
kids for an extended period of time, because one parent can=92t meet the =
needs of all four - with a 21 month old, a four year old, and 9 year old =
with ADHD and possible depression, and a 12 year old with ADHD, =
explosive anger, history of self-harm and suicidal talk.

Once we=92ve made the case that I=92m not a threat, and that her =
behaviour was illegal and unfounded, maybe this could add weight to our =
argument.

Thanks,
Darryl
