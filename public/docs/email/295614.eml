So I got in contact with the family wizard, and signed up, so we can move co=
mmunication about the girls over there.

As for tomorrow, it won't work either - we've got plans all day. I think I'l=
l be fine getting the place ready on my own, after all. We should try to hav=
e it listed by the first week of January. We'll do CommFree, right?
