Hi Darryl,

I think I have found a temporary solution for the Tuesday nights remainder
of the soccer season ( until September 12).

Another team similar to Alice=E2=80=99s level practices Tuesday nights at 5=
 pm at
Half Moon Bay Park right before Charlotte=E2=80=99s team. I am going to ask=
 if Ali
can swap this practice with Wednesday for the rest of the season.

Would your mom and yourself be available next week for visits to take place
on Wednesday instead of Tuesday?


No news on Fall soccer -/-there will be sort outs and then teams will be
divided again.  I am hopeful they won=E2=80=99t fall on Sunday afternoon.


Cynthia
