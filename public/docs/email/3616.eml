Hi Cynthia,<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
I apologize for not being in touch sooner, but I was unable to be for medica=
l reasons. <br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
I want to assure you that I have every intention of paying support, and catc=
hing up. Since I=E2=80=99ve been off work I haven=E2=80=99t received pay. I h=
ad to submit paperwork which I was only able to do a few days ago. So when m=
y pay comes through I will be sure to send what I can to you, and then make s=
ure I=E2=80=99m up to date as soon as possible. <br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
