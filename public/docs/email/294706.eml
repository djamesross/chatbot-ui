Hi Darryl,

I agree with the approach and the words suggested about what happened. I
have spoken to the girls about it and they understand and I said you would
be speaking with them too.. ..I think the explanation is honest and age
appropriate.

However, I am concerned about you saying telling them this will never
happen again, I know you want this to be true and we are all hopeful it
will be but you may relapse or have a slip up and then you are breaking a
promise to them which is worse. I think saying you are working your hardest
to make sure it doesn't happen again is a better approach.

Cynthia
