Hi Any,

I haven=E2=80=99t heard from her yet - she can be very slow returning =
emails.

I=E2=80=99m not sure about the custody assessment. To be honest, I =
don=E2=80=99t know if I could find the money to pay for half of it. =
However, I=E2=80=99d like to remind Cynthia that she agreed to it, and =
keep it as an option, with the hope that she will be more cooperative to =
avoid it. What do you think?

Darryl
