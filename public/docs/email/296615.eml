Hi Darryl,=20

I am sorry to hear that the situation is deteriorating and you are so =
worried about your daughters.  Do you still have access to their school =
reports and can you talk directly with their teachers? If possible, I =
would suggest that without implying anything negative, you approach =
their teachers to ask about their observations of the girls. Do they =
seem happy?  Do they have friends? Are they progressing as expected? You =
can ask these questions as an interested parent (not based on any =
concerns).  If the teachers have concerns, the next step may involve =
speaking with the principal and trying to arrange for a joint parent =
conference.  The whole point is to have object third parties who have =
direct observations of your children and who would also be able to =
observe if Cynthia is acting in their best interest.  Having third party =
involvement should help Cynthia to be focused on the girls' well being.  =
Due to the conflict between you, it would likely be best that Cynthia =
not know that you prompted this.  I think if you ask the school to do =
this without indicating that the initial contact came from you and they =
do have concerns, it should be fine.  School personal are generally =
aware of the complications of high conflict parental separations. =20

I hope this is helpful.  Please take care of yourself as you know your =
own mental health is at risk and you have already been through a  lot.  =
You cannot be there for your daughters if you are a mess and as you say, =
missteps on your part only serve to strengthen Cynthia=E2=80=99s case =
against you. =20

Take care,
Sharon=20

Her parents are getting sick of supervising, so last week when there was =
