I=E2=80=99ve pasted my response below, in case the last email didn=E2=80=99=
t work:
=20

5. Charlotte never claimed I bit her, but I would also never ask her to =
make that claim or deny her if she did. What comments did her mother =
make? There is so much innuendo! Linda has never raised concerns with. =
In fact, she has always talked about me as a great parent and committed =
father.

=20

6. I=E2=80=99m always under the influence of anti-depressants because I =
follow my doctor=E2=80=99s advice, and I don=E2=80=99t drink more than =
two drinks on a regular basis. I am and continue to see Dr. Douglass, =
who reports that I have made a =E2=80=9Cwonderful=E2=80=9D improvement. =
I saw him Tuesday morning. He recommended that I continue to take my =
current medication as support during this stressful time. I never =
disregard the doctor=E2=80=99s advice. I am a conscientious patient.

=20

7. The CAS is investigating because of the nature of the allegations =
made =E2=80=93 not because of any particular evidence or evident =
concerns. Heather Clark met with Cynthia, Ben and the girls this morning =
(it=E2=80=99s not clear why Ben stayed home from school, while Sam did =
not, unless it was only to see the CAS worker). Heather told me that the =
girls are doing very well, that Charlotte does  not appear to know what =
is going on, and believes that this is a kind of extended vacation. I =
made arrangements for Heather to see me in our house, as soon as she =
could (Monday, November 23, at 9:00 am).

=20

8. Why did it take the CAS to =E2=80=98prompt=E2=80=99 her to take =
Charlotte to CHEO if she had ANY concerns? And why did Cynthia wait 9 =
days to do so? As soon as I found out about the examination at CHEO I =
contacted medical records and made an urgent request. I met with the =
nurse who admitted Charlottle, who explained to me what happened, what =
the examination included, and what the chart said. The results were =
clear: there was no evidence of abuse of any kind, and she is clear of =
STIs. The doctor referred her to the Child and Youth Protection Team =
based solely on Cynthia=E2=80=99s allegations, and as a matter practice.

=20

Cynthia did not act on her concerns in a manner consistent with a parent =
who believes that her child was sexually assaulted, and when a physical =
examination was performed, no evidence of abuse was found. Charlotte is =
described by the attending physician as =E2=80=9Cappropriate cooperative =
well cared for clean well groom=E2=80=9D (sic).

=20

Furthermore, based on information provided by her own laywer, the police =
have decided that there are no grounds to investigate the claims made. =
The police have not contacted me. However, I did visit a City of Ottawa =
police station to request a copy of the report. Unfortunately, based on =
the criteria laid out in Freedom of Information legislation, they could =
not release it to me. Cynthia has not included it with her affidavit.

=20

9. I believe that this is an emergency situation. Mrs. Holmes is acting =
irrationally and without cause. Her allegations have no basis in fact. =
The police decided not to investigate, and the examination at CHEO found =
no evidence of abuse. Cynthia is continuing to make allegations, and to =
refuse me reasonable access to my children based solely on those =
allegations.

=20

Over the past year, Cynthia has claimed that she was sexually assaulted =
by her father, past partners, and during her high school graduation. =
Cynthia has refused to discuss the matter with her father, further =
claiming that he is an alcoholic and that she will not meet him until he =
is ready to face both his alcoholism and sexual abuse.

=20

In the spring of 2015 Cynthia informed Scott Leclair, the father of Ben =
and Sam, that he was no longer allowed to see the boys during the week. =
In the past, he would spend time with them for one evening each week, =
and every other weekend. She reduced his visitation to every other =
weekend based on her concerns of emotional abuse. This can be confirmed =
by Dr. James, who also filed a complaint against Scott Leclair based =
exclusively on testimony by Cynthia. At that time Cynthia also raised =
concerns about Scott tickling the boys too affectionately, and helping =
Sam to bath himself. She was concerned that his touching crossed healthy =
boundaries. At no point did either Ben or Sam suggest that they were =
uncomfortable with their father. On the contrary, they had a close =
physical relationship that seemed genuine and appropriate.

=20

Unfortunately, Cynthia is making similar claims against me, at a time =
when I was preparing to leave our relationship. I strongly feel that her =
erratic decisions, shrill accusations, and refusal to allow me =
reasonable access constitute an emergency situation. On the date of this =
filing, it will have been 12 days since I have seen any of my children. =
And during that time Cynthia has kept both girls at her mother=E2=80=99s =
house, while making allegations about me as a pedophile, and taking =
Charlotte for an examination at CHEO.

=20

10. I am fully cooperating with the investigation initiated by Cynthia, =
and have made arrangements to meet the case worker, Heather Clark, at =
her earliest convenience. I would have arranged to see her sooner if I =
had been made aware of the accusations against me.

=20

The girls are allowed to speak to me each day in the evening. However, =
the time is limited to 5-6 minutes, and Cynthia or her mother is present =
and frequently speaking over the kids. They often call amidst noise, =
which makes it difficult for me to hear what the kids are saying. I have =
not been able to have a relaxed or natural conversation with any of the =
children.

=20

11. Cynthia was recently on sick leave (I don=E2=80=99t know the exact =
dates, but for at least half of October).

=20

14. By making rash allegations against me, refusing me reasonable =
access, and completely disregarding the status quo, Cynthia has shown by =
her actions that she does not want me to have a full and healthy =
relationship with the children. I was an involved parent, doing most of =
the parenting, up the morning that she removed the girls. In fact, that =
morning I got both girls dressed and ready, before they left with =
Cynthia.

=20

I am concerned about the nature of the information that Cynthia is =
sharing with Charlotte=E2=80=99s school and Alice=E2=80=99s caregiver. =
If it includes any suggestion that I have sexually assaulted either of =
my daughters, my position in the school and community will be negatively =
impacted. These are extremely serious allegations based on what she has =
described as =E2=80=98bizzare behaviour=E2=80=99 and comments that her =
mother has made.

=20

15. They only started an investigation because of her allegations!

=20

16. There are no red flags in Dr. Bhatt=E2=80=99s report =E2=80=93 only =
a summary of the allegations made by Cynthia.

=20

17. There is no reason to believe that I would remove Charlotte from =
school. I took her every morning to a summer program offered by the =
school to transition her to full-day kindergarten in French. While =
Charlotte was at school, I would take Alice to the park, or play with =
her at home. I would then pick Charlotte up from school at noon, and =
spend the rest of the afternoon and evening looking after the girls, and =
the boys, if they were not in camp or with the father.

=20

I have continued to play a significant role in Charlotte=E2=80=99s =
education, taking her to school and picking her up most days of the =
week.

=20

Cynthia did not contact the school until Thursday of last week. The =
principle informed me that Cynthia asked if they could email a few =
activities for Charlotte to do while she is away from school. The =
principle did not know when Charlotte would return, and was told by =
Cynthia that it probably be another week.

=20

18. Cynthia has never spoken well of Scott. Quite the contrary, as the =
emails and Dr. James=E2=80=99 notes will show. Cynthia has been =
concerned about Scott=E2=80=99s relationship with the boys for the =
entire time that I have known him. As stated about, citing concerns =
about emotional abuse, and in particular harsh treatment of Ben, she =
reduced his access to the boys. In support of her decision, she referred =
to the call to CAS by Dr. James, which was based on her recounting of =
something that Ben told her that his dad said to him.

=20

Cynthia=E2=80=99s behavior shows a clear pattern in which she makes an =
allegation, and then uses the results of that allegation to justify =
drastic changes to the status quo.

=20

Cynthia has indeed relied heavily on Scott Leclair to care for the boys =
while she has been staying with her parents. However, prior to her =
removal of the children from the house, she did not have a positive =
relationship with him.

=20

19. In fact for much 2014 and 2015 I consumed little or no alcohol. In =
particular, through the winter, spring and much of the summer, at a time =
when I was most depressed, I rarely consumed alcohol. The exception was =
rare family events, or an occasional drink with dinner. It was not until =
my depression started to lift, in August, that I began to consume 1-2 =
drinks a day, on average. I raised this concern with my psychiatrist, =
Dr. Douglass, explaining that I enjoy craft beer. I asked him if =
consuming 1-2 drinks would interfere with the medication that I am =
currently on, and he said it would not.

=20

I experience health problems for most of my adult life, which Cynthia is =
aware of. At the time we met, the cause was not clear. It was not until =
I underwent a sleep study at the Royal Ottawa Hospital that I discovered =
that I have a form of sleep disorder breathing, called Upper Airway =
Resistance Syndrome (UARS). I started treatment immediately, and have =
continued it everyday since. Treating UARS resolved most, but not all of =
my symptoms. I continued to experience mild depression, diagnosed by Dr. =
Dounglass in the spring of 2014. As soon as I was diagnosed I began to =
see a therapist, Dr. Carol Milstone, who I continue to see on a regular =
basis. The depression I experienced was transient and mild for 2014, but =
became worse during the winter of 2015. It became moderate to severe =
during from approximately March-July of 2015. Dr. Douglass was very =
concerned for my well-being at the time. Both Dr. Milstone and Dr. =
Douglass support the theory that I was depressed because of a =
combination of genetics/psychology and my current life situation. At =
that time, and continuing to the present, Ben was prone to violent and =
aggressive outbursts, at times scaring his siblings and damaging objects =
in the house. At the same time, Cynthia was also prone to outbursts of =
anger, though these have reduced since she began antidepressant =
medication, which help her to manage her temper and emotions.

=20

However, at no point during the winter, spring or summer did Cynthia =
express any concerns about me as a parent. Nor did she offer to take on =
more of the parenting or housework. She was content to let me be the =
primary caregiver to the girls, and to spend long periods of time with =
the boys. She did not express concern about my relationship with either =
of the boys, and frequently described me to friends, family, and Dr. =
James, as the calm, reasonable one.

=20

It was not until we began marriage counseling and I shared my concerns =
about our relationship with Cynthia that she began to raise concerns =
about me as a parent, and as far as I know most of those have only been =
raised in the past six weeks. During that time I have not consumed more =
alcohol, I have not changed my parenting style, and I my mental health =
has improved markedly.

=20

20. I was inebriated at a few weddings in 2014, and a few family =
occasions in 2015. I was stressed, overworked, in an unhappy marriage, =
and an explosive household, in which angry outbursts were common.

=20

I have never bitten Alice. And as far as I am aware Cynthia has never =
taken Alice to a doctor for being bit, and has never taken Alice to the =
doctor to look for signs of sexual abuse.

=20

21. I do not drink 4-5 drinks a day. I drink on average about 2 drinks a =
day, and not every day. There is no basis for Cynthia=E2=80=99s =
accusations.

=20

23. Offering a dedicated and committed father, who was the primary care =
giver of four children for most of the summer, and for the girls all of =
the time, is completely unreasonable. I have consistently proven myself =
to be a good and caring father, who acts in the best interests of my =
children. I initiated or asked Cynthia to initiate treatment for Ben and =
Sam=E2=80=99s mental health issues. I have consistently participated in =
those treatments, often taking the boys to appointments or attending =
information meetings or courses when Cynthia could not.

=20

24. I did not make that threat to Cynthia. In fact we did not have a =
loud or angry argument. I do not believe that Ben was scared by that =
situation.

=20

25. Ben was frequently scared. Earlier that day ran upstairs to his mom =
because he thought there was an intruder in the house. Later that =
evening he was scared because he thought someone was outside of the =
house. He called from a movie theatre on one occasion, asking to be =
picked up, because a person near had a bag on their lap, and Ben =
believed there was a gun in that bag (there was not).

=20

26. We did not share a laugh, if that=E2=80=99s even worth saying.

=20

27. There is some truth to her account here, but she was just as engaged =
in the conversation as we were. However, I asked her early on to go to =
her parents, saying that I would be more comfortable, and that Ben needs =
her. She said she will not because she is sticking up for herself.

=20

28. Cynthia did not show concern for Ben=E2=80=99s feelings. Knowing =
that he was afraid, she left him to come home to me and an empty house =
the next day after school. She had told me that I would see Ben on =
Sunday, and she had not prepared Ben at all, contrary to the plan that =
we made with Dr. James.

=20

Cynthia also brought Ben with her to the house the following Tuesday. =
When Ben showed concern that I might show up, she told him to knock on =
the door if I did, and left him outside for 7-8 minutes while she =
collected some belongings. This behavior is not consistent with =
Cynthia=E2=80=99s alleged concern for the well-being of herself, or Ben.

=20

30. The focus of the session was on removing the children from the home. =
Dr. James made it clear that she viewed Cynthia=E2=80=99s action as a =
mistake, and cautioned Cynthia not to involve her parents, because that =
is prone to escalate the situation.

=20

Why did Cynthia fail to mention the blood-stained PJs, which are =
described the medical report from CHEO? In that same medical report, =
Cynthia accuses me of biting Charlotte twice.

=20

33. Cynthia has at no point offered me reasonable access. If I were to =
accept the ridiculous terms she has offered, knowing how committed I am =
to the girls, it would be even more difficult to return the girls to =
their lives, their routines, and the status quo.

=20

Cynthia is using my commitment to the girls against me, knowing that I =
will not act rashly, or attempt to take the girls back, or remove =
Charlotte from school, because that would potentially hurt and confuse =
them.=
