Hi Any,

I=92ve been thinking about this, and everything I know about Cynthia =
says that she=92s not going to give up. When she=92s backed into a =
corner, she attacks. She always has. It=92s why I backed down from her =
for so long, and I think it=92s why Scott gave up so much access to the =
boys. She just doesn=92t stop. I will be very surprised if she doesn=92t =
come up with more accusations.=20

I=92m not sure if I sent this to you, but I made a list of the complains =
she=92s made about sexual abuse in the last 18 months. It=92s pretty =
shocking to see it laid out in a list - I feel like I=92m just part of a =
pattern for her. (Most/all of it should be supported by emails, texts =
and therapy records).

2014:=20
Cynthia tells me that her first long-term boyfriend, Ryan Ellson, =
emotionally abused her in ways that related to their sex life. She =
blames him for the difficulties that she has experienced during sex =
since leaving him.
Cynthia accuses her father of sexually abusing her. She describes it as =
=91non-contact sexual assault=92, and says that it included exposing her =
to pornography, unusually loud sex, and exposing himself to her. (She =
also accused him of being an alcoholic. He denied both.)
2015:=20
Cynthia becomes concerned about the boys=92s father and inappropriate =
boundaries. She tells Dr. James the Scott is tickling the boys in =
inappropriate places (erogenous zones), and bathing Sam.
Cynthia becomes concerned about the relationship between Scott=92s =
in-laws and Sam. She becomes extremely worried that Tracy=92s father is =
molesting Sam.
After starting couple=92s counselling, Cynthia tells me that she has =
recently realized she was date raped on the night of her high school =
graduation. She says that until very recently she blames herself, but =
has come to accept that it was in fact date rape.
During couple=92s counselling, Cynthia tells me that she was sexually =
assaulted by her first long-term boyfriend, Ryan Ellson (same as above).
In November of this year, after a particularly stressful period of time, =
and following discussions which included the topic of separation, =
Cynthia took our children from our home and accused me of sexually =
assaulting our oldest daughter.
So, in roughly the past 18 months, Cynthia has accused or suspected six =
people of sexually assaulting her or our children. None of them have =
admitted to the accusations. I have been the only person investigated =
based on her accusations, and no evidence has emerged supporting any of =
her accusations or suspicions of me or anyone else.

I=92ll hold off picking the girls up for now, but it really feels like =
I=92m letting her dictate the terms of my relationship with them. I =
really want to spend normal time with the girls, and I know that they =
need that too. This really feels like a hostage situation.

Darryl
