Thanks. And I'm sorry if that was rude or sarcastic. I'm just upset at
seeing how this affects the girls, being treated like an unwanted
obligation, and am working hard to change the temporary motion, and don't
understand your decisions. I would really like to know why, and am willing
to listen. The girls have to come first.

And lastly, I don't know who is making the decisions, but it could
seriously backfire. And i may not like what you do, but i don't want to see
that happen. They deserve two healthy happy parents, and want time with
both of us.
