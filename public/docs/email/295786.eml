Hi Dr. Blouin,

I'm writing with regard to Ben Leclair, and our appointment about his progr=
ess, on Tuesday, July 9, at 5:30 pm. After the meeting I spoke to you brief=
ly to share my concerns about his father. I was surprised to hear so much a=
bout bullying during the session. Ben has been quite open about feeling bul=
lied on a couple of occasions, but both his mom and I are at the school fre=
quently, and see his teacher often, and have not noticed or heard about bul=
lying. Below I describe some concerns I have with his father's behaviour, t=
hat I think relate to Ben's anxiety and underdeveloped sense of self, which=
 I believe is more significant.

Each weekend that Ben spends with his father involve 'fights,' as Ben descr=
ibes them. Based on Ben's description, they can last less than an hour or s=
pan most of the weekend. These fights seem to be based on opposition by Ben=
, or missed expectations by Ben or his father. (Ben may be disappointed tha=
t plans fell through, or Scott may be disappointed that Ben didn't seem tha=
nkful enough for something he did).  Ben feels an incredible amount of guil=
t for these fights. He has told us, with conviction, that they are his faul=
t. He will argue the point, in fact. For example, he has described the amou=
nt of work that his dad puts into the weekends, which might include making =
a special dinner, hosting a birthday party, or just spending 'quality' time=
 together, and how he ruined it. To avoid confusion: this is Ben telling us=
 that he (Ben) is responsible for the fights, for ruining the special times=
, and for upsetting his dad. After these weekends his dad will call more fr=
equently - up to five times in an evening, including within minutes of leav=
ing - and have long talks with Ben, during which Ben is silent save the occ=
asional 'uh-huh,' 'yes,' 'I don't know,' 'no I'm not mad at you,' etc. Afte=
r a few of these calls, his dad will start to tell him about the big plans =
for the next weekend. Ben will repeat these plans, call his dad and tell hi=
m how excited he is to see him, that he can't wait to see him, etc. Leading=
 up to a weekend - especially a 'big' weekend - Ben becomes more anxious. R=
ecently he's told us that he's worried about ruining the weekend and upsett=
ing his dad. After one weekend of fights, Scott told Ben that his girlfrien=
d and her son might not come around much/anymore if he didn't change his be=
haviour. His father often misses Tuesday nights, and on a few occasions tol=
d Ben that he doesn't want to do them if Ben doesn't change his behavior (a=
gain, the 'fights' are always Ben's fault). It is very difficult for Ben wh=
en his father misses a Tuesday night, or weekend. When his father does miss=
 a night, big promises of fun and special times and promises follow, which =
are talked about on the phone each day leading up to the weekend - which ne=
ver work out the way Ben hoped, and for which he is left feeling guilty.

Cynthia and I both had an 'ah-ha' moment when you expressed concern over Be=
n's willingness to give up his rewards. This is behaviour that his father r=
einforces often. He will tell Ben how nice he is, how good he is, for shari=
ng, giving, etc. From my perspective, Scott seems to reward this behaviour =
more than any other, and Ben responds in kind. In fact it is difficult for =
us to encourage Ben not to share. He will argue with us using what seems to=
 me to be the language of his father (I am, of course, the stepfather, and =
may be reading into what Ben says, but the phrases and ideas that Ben uses =
are not of Ben's style at all).

Ben is currently on medication for ADHD. His father opposes medication. Ear=
ly on he attended a doctor's appointment and met with Ben's teacher. Howeve=
r, after they expressed support, he stopped meeting with them (including sk=
ipping an appointment made with Ben's teacher). He does not attend doctor's=
 appointments, even though Ben is being treated at the ADHD clinic at CHEO.=
 His father has sent dramatic emails claiming his sweet boy is being change=
d by the medication (which is at a very low dose). What concerns me is that=
 Scott frequently talks to Ben about the medication. After spending a weeke=
nd with his father, Ben told us that we hate him and we are trying to chang=
e his personality by giving him drugs. Scott has told Ben that Ben does not=
 have ADHD, and that the medication is bad. In the beginning he knew that h=
is dad disapproved, but recently his dad has tried to fight Cynthia's decis=
ion through Ben, adding more stress. Ben feels extremely loyal to his dad, =
and it is difficult for him to reconcile what his mom and I, his teacher, a=
nd his doctors say, with what his dad tells him.

Scott seems to feel a great deal of guilt for the role he plays in the boys=
' lives, but will never say that he has to miss a day, take them home early=
, or change plans, which frequently happens. He always convinces them that =
what is happening is for the best. For instance, when he and his previous g=
irlfriend split up, he told the boys it's for the best because she never sp=
ent time with them, and his dad had to do all the work of taking care of th=
em. When he moved far from the city, it was to buy a place with a pool that=
's close to the ski hill. But they skied only once because having the boys =
for the weekend is hard and they want 'special time' together. But they can=
't have special time because he's working so hard to make them dinner and d=
o fun things for them. But he will buy Ben a bike next weekend. But they co=
uldn't go to the store (and have never bought one) because shopping isn't s=
pecial time. And his dad would love to come to see him play soccer but he's=
 got really important meetings in the evenings. And they were going to go t=
o soccer on the weekend but they wanted special time, which is more importa=
nt. And he never bought the house with the pool near the ski hill because i=
t's way better to buy a house in Kanata because it's closer and has this an=
d that advantage. All of this, of course, is coming from Ben. At each chang=
e, broken promise, disappointment, Ben puts all of his energy into explaini=
ng why - though we don't ask - his dad just had to make a meeting, or just =
couldn't give up special time, etc., etc. Ben does not seem to be able to s=
ay that he is mad or disappointed with his dad. If he does express either f=
eeling he feels very guilty and immediately describes how much he loves his=
 dad, and how much his dad does for him. If he expresses either feeling to =
his dad - even subtly - his dad begins to call frequently and has long talk=
s with him, during which Ben quickly changes to complimenting his dad and t=
alking about the next big thing and how excited he is. Based on what Cynthi=
a has told me about her time with Scott, nothing can ever by his fault and =
he smothers until he finds some sort of relief from guilt. She would often =
give in just to get some space. This seems to happen to Ben, too.

This is what I can think of off the top of my head. It is from my perspecti=
ve as the step-father, which must be taken into account, of course, but I h=
ope this gives you a sense of the pressures Ben faces from his father.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help. Cynthia and =
I are discussing making another appointment to talk in more detail about ou=
r role, and how we can change the way that we interact with Ben to help him=
.

Best,
Darryl
