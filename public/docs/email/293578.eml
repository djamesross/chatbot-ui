Hi Darryl.=C2=B4,

Ms Lendor will have to discuss with Alison Boyce upon her return.

All the information concerning our trip is in the email sent from Ms.
Boyce=E2=80=99s office to Ms. Lendors.

I am aware the girls have been speaking to you about this trip in detail
and excitement.

Thank you.

Cynthia
