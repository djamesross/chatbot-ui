That is a lot to do.  I think we really need to start talking about a =
schedule. They were hoping to spend more time here too, and I just =
missed them for a week. Tomorrow after work is fine, but maybe we can =
fit in a visit before Sunday, or start going longer periods. What do you =
think? Either way, please let me about plans before they are set. I=E2=80=99=
m really flexible, and I=E2=80=99m sure we can always work out important =
things.
