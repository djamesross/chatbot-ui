Hi,

Thank you for letting me know about the parent meeting and practice. For =
this week, I agree to reschedule our Tuesday time to Friday. However, I =
want to clarify that this change is an exception and does not alter the =
established schedule as per our court order. If you are seeking to =
change the court order, please have your lawyer communicate with me =
directly.

I look forward to seeing the girls on Friday.

Darryl
