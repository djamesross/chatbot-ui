Hi Allison,

Do you have time to talk briefly about the current situation?  Right =
now, with the constant issues, her control and interference, and the =
uncertainty for me and for Charlotte and Alice - this is about as good =
as things were 3 years ago, under the previous court order. It got a =
little better sometimes, much worse at others, up until she completely =
denied access for over two years. Right now, in real time, is what =
actually happened those times she swore in her affidavit that I =
'disappeared' and harmed the children with 'my' irregular and limited =
contact with the girls.

Also, I=E2=80=99d like to arrange the make-up visit with Alice for next =
Monday, 11am-3pm. My will pick her up and drop her off. Can you =
communicate that to Cynthia=E2=80=99s lawyer? As far as I know they do =
not have camp or plans next week (according to the girls and Ms. =
Boyce=E2=80=99s letter).=20

Thank you,

Darryl
