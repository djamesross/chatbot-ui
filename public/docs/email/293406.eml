Dear Ms. Boyce,

There is a long list of questions that I have asked concerning my =
daughters. Most of those questions have been directly ignored. They were =
asked repeatedly and long ago and none of them should be problematic or =
subject to further delay. Unnecessary delay is a matter for the motion =
your client has brought.=20

As I have communicated I have not been provided even the most basic and =
essential information necessary to make decisions about the well being =
of my daughters. My affidavit will include empirical record of my =
ongoing requests, the responses I received, and your client=E2=80=99s =
decisions to enable or interfere with access.=20

I formally request all of that information by December 1 so that I might =
be able to respond with an affidavit that can reasonably takes into =
account  my daughters well being.

In response to a letter provided by Dr. Bowling it was communicated to =
me that a complete denial of access waas deemed necessary by your =
client. Your client has now brought a motion that will not be =
successful. Since that time your client has changed her mind.=20

I will ask Dr. Bowling to provide an updated letter directly from his =
office by Dec. 1st.=20

Disclosure as directly required by court order and child support =
guidelines will provided as soon as possible.

I ask that your client do the same.

I kindly request confirmation of this email in its entirety by Nov. 30.

Thank-you,

Darryl Ross=
