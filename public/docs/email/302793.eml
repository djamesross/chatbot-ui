> And I hope this time it is true. Please understand the motion has to go ah=
ead and would be better done cooperatively, as per our agreement. However, g=
iven the amount of time the girls and I have lost based on innuendo and rumo=
r, while you refused to see, talk, meditate or have someone mediate on your b=
ehalf, you caused the girls confusion, sadness, and continually directed you=
r actions toward me. You made them more anxious by telling them I am sick wi=
thout any medical evidence, complaint, safety concern, and while avoiding se=
eing me as much as possible which would have made clear I have maintained so=
briety and my health. I will email Alison and hope we can avoid an adversari=
al motion, but a final order will have to be made, and I hope we can do it c=
ooperatively. To give you some warning, the first thing I will be seeking is=
 make-up time. I encourage you to speak to your lawyer about it before makin=
g a rash decision. I've come to learn that judges don't enjoy games, you've m=
ade every attempt to make me the last and priority in their lives, and each a=
nd every time you or your lawyer has informed me that it will be a few days,=
 this was clearly a tactic, and today is an example. There is nothing more i=
mportant right now than establishing a civil regular routine for the girls, y=
et you have acted contrary to the principle of maximum contact. I have very l=
ittle that needs to be said at the motion should you force it, so my stateme=
nts will be short, but my exhibits will not, and I will be requesting affida=
vits in addition. All of this stuff about me taking the girls away is for yo=
u to deal with. To date, you are the only one to do so, twice, and without c=
ause. When there was cause I cooperated.
>=20
> As a further warning out of concern, because you are the parent of my daug=
hters and believe it or not I want to see you do well despite your actions, I=
 don't want to see this turn out worse than it has, so I encourage you to av=
oid people who have their own agendas that care nothing for you and little c=
are for our daughters. You explicitly stated in writing during the summer th=
at you would have nothing to do with my family matters, in particular, those=
 financial. That does not appear to have been the case at all and was stated=
 very directly when I was attempting to tell you that issues were arising bu=
t despite their efforts, child support is primary and will come first. That w=
as all I had to say, and yet you did not give me the chance. Without making a=
ny accusations, it has the appearance of malicious intent. I will be raising=
 that issue as well as the hardship caused by your decision to refuse to let=
 me see my daughters as soon as I found a suitable place as we agreed, which=
 should have triggered our agreement and enabled the girls two loving parent=
s. That hurt them, and I may have no choice but to seek redress if this cont=
inues..
>=20
> I will explain this to Alison but this time it will be up to you to decide=
 whether or not you would like to make the effort to settle this amicably or=
 proceed to court. I've stated my position many times but will do so once ag=
ain, the girls' interests are paramount, and conflict, not divorce or separa=
tion, is what causes damage.=20
>=20
> It was easy enough to pressure and threaten me when I struggled with addic=
tion. I was vulnerable and scared. That is no longer the case. My daughters a=
re and will remain my central focus, and they should be yours as well. Despi=
te your near silence, your actions show are without doubt to the contrary.=20=

>=20
> As for today, the last email you sent to your mother was an answer to whic=
h library you were referring to. However, given the level of control and int=
erference, you have demonstrated it may well have been another order to me, a=
bout where and when I can see my daughters. If you can't see by now that you=
 are the only parent to break agreements and withhold the children as well a=
s purger yourself in your initial affidavit, perhaps you could ask Charlotte=
 and Alice, as opposed to fitting their right to spend time with me into you=
r schedule. I have asked them so I know the places the would like to go, but=
 as long as you are using them to force your schedule on us I will meet them=
 where I can until this ends in by us moving in agreement back to the shared=
 custody we established this summer, or by order of the court.
>=20
> And one last request, which I have made before. After years of hearing you=
 complain Scott interfered with phone calls, often speaking over Ben and Sam=
, answering for them, and curring them short, would you please allow me to s=
peak to my daughters in a reasonable way, allow them to use the telephone, a=
nd be allowed to call me if they ask. Kindly provide numbers where I can rea=
ch them, and allow them to reach me. That is not an unreasonable request and=
 would help to show some good faith, and that you are not trying constantly t=
rying to interfere with their right to develop a relationship with me indepe=
ndent of you.
>=20
> Now it's 11, and I have final marks due tomorrow which means a long night.=
 Are you amenable to the girls spending time with me at the college, or do y=
ou insist I bus back to Barrhaven and then back to the college?=20
