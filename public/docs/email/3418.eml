I have not had a response and have been expecting the girls to come for a
visit. But this continually happens =E2=80=93 I receive no consideration th=
at I
have a life, responsibilities, and a job. Yet the one topic you will not
hesitate to communicate about is money. I must submit final grades tomorrow
morning by 9 am, which will take hours. Today =E2=80=93 in fact the entire =
time
since August =E2=80=93 has been completely unnecessary and unjustified and =
has
included so much wasted time. I desperately want to see my daughters, but I
cannot continue to meet demands at your whim, without serious consequences
for my students and my job. I remain hopeful they are coming, but I cannot
travel to and from the places you dictate and meet work deadlines tonight.

You have my address: 13 Alfa st., Nepean. Please let me know if you want to
make this work for our daughters.

Otherwise I accept your refusal to communicate or cooperate as a denial of
their right to see me. In which case they deserve an appropriate
explanation they can understand, which does not indicate there is a
conflict between us, does not place blame on either of us, and does not
leave them thinking I did not try to or want to see them. You have already
told me they will phone, which I appreciate. . I kindly ask that you allow
them reasonable privacy, and not continue to use speaker phone and
continually interrupt.

Finally, I am owed make up time tomorrow, or this will be a complete
refusal to allow me to see my daughters. I kindly ask we arrange a time
that works for all of us.
