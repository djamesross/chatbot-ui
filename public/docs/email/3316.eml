Hi Cynthia,

I want to firm up the extended time with the girls this Sunday for =
Thanksgiving. I am planning a meal with them, as well as time for some =
activities. I think that more than 2 hour is appropriate, especially =
given how well visits have been going and that they have been asking for =
more time, and because Monday is a holiday. Can they be dropped off =
would be after the run with their cousins in the morning, or by noon?
