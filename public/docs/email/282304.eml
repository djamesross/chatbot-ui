Hi Darryl,

It's too bad Angie and Evie couldn't make it.

In terms of costs, there are plenty. Breakdown:

Costumes                 $200
Tights (camel and pink)   $28
Hair pins/gel             $12
Lipstick                     $10
MiniRoots Tryout      $140

Total                          $380
*Darryl's contribution    - $50*

Grand Total              * $330*

So split between two is* $165.*

Also there are the two classes that I have paid for the entire season which
was *$629.24.*
