Hi Cynthia,

10 am tomorrow morning is great. I will be available when they FaceTime.

I look forward to talking to them again, and seeing them open their =
gifts, at 10 am on Boxing Day.

I believe we may have a misunderstanding concerning visits, and =
unfortunately Ms. Boyce has been unavailable since the motion.=20

As I recall Justice Summers=E2=80=99s encouraged us to make as much =
progress as possible until the next motion, and to follow the Court =
Order as long as there is satisfactory evidence of sobriety, and as long =
as it is safe for the children. She suggested outdoor activities given =
the season, and made disclosure due no later than Jan. 28.

At the motion Ms. Boyce stated that she was on holiday starting end of =
day, leaving her unavailable to make progress until the New Year. It is =
my understanding that the agreement with Justice Summers that we would =
arrange visits was so that our daughters could have some time with me =
was interim, and not dependent on receiving all of the disclosure =
requested in the Confirmation of Motion or Affidavit.

Presently, there is the note referred to in your affidavit, which is =
dated September 1, 2021. The follow-up note that his office sent =
directly too Ms. Boyce on September 9, 2021, clarifies that I am tested =
for alcohol and drugs. On December 6, 2021, I provided Ms. Boyce with a =
new letter, including date and reference to alcohol and drugs, stating =
that:

	"He voluntarily provides a urine sample weekly, on which we =
perform a drug screen.  We use these tests to ensure continued =
abstinence from alcohol and illicit substances.  After meeting with Mr. =
Ross today, December 1, 2021, and reviewing of his most recent notes and =
drugs screens, I can comfortably state that I currently have no concerns =
about Mr. Ross from a substance use perspective."

If Ms. Boyce has not made the second two documents available to you =
please let me know and I will.

With your neighbour Maureen supervising, and meeting me first, I believe =
this provides greater assurance than the safety plan that we made with =
the Children=E2=80=99s Aid Society in May of 2019.

I kindly ask that you reconsider allowing interim supervised visits =
until both Ms. Boyce and Allison return, and have a chance to review all =
of the disclosure, in the spirit of Justice Summers direction.

Regards,

Darryl
