Accidental dial. Hung up as fast as I could, hoping it didn't disturbed
you.  I can meet at 1 pm. We had a really good time on boxing day but it
was really rushed. I was hoping to play with the girls and their toys and
especially help Char setup Vector. She really gets it, intuitively and
quickly, but I think there's some things that I need to show her.  I can
show you as well how it works, like passwords, and how it has Alexa but it
can't make phone calls and it can't play music, and all that stuff. It
would be really great if they could come to my place for a bit.
