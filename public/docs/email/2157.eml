<DIV>What are your plans Tuesday during the day? I am working from home but am flexible to drop by the GLEBE for a java. I know that's your prep day for the evening class so if it doesn't work, that's totally cool.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Gotta boil some potatoes!</DIV>

<DIV>I've always needed good rest and a regular schedule (as my mom tends to point out). But work is actually going quite well today regardless, so I'm happy. An afternoon delight would make things even brighter!</DIV>

<DIV>Glad to hear things are getting done. Got a name yet?</DIV><BR>

<DIV>Awww, sorry to hear that it's taking awhile to get back to 100%. Yes, I am in agreement with you that those late nights should be rare (my poor lady bit is still recovering:).&nbsp;Maybe an afternoon delight would be better. Hmmmm....</DIV>

<DIV>My Monday is going really well. We just met with&nbsp;the department big wigs&nbsp;and finally got some things accomplished. &nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Gotta run and heat up Friday's leftovers. I wasn't thinking, I should have given them to you!</DIV>

<DIV>It was well worth it : )</DIV>

<DIV>I'm not feeling refreshed yet though, even with a nap and a good night sleep; it'll take a couple days to feel energized again (which is why those late nights must be rare!)&nbsp;</DIV>
