Hi Darryl,

Sorry I was unaware Thursday FT did not happen. Charlotte usually manages
it well. Alice and I leave for soccer at 6pm on Thursday, so 5 pm works. If
you can't reach them, please send me a text and I will follow up with girls
to make sure they FT you.

Tutoring has ended for the summer, our tutor Solomn has been absent for
a few weeks and we only have a few sessions left so I cancled as he was
unreliable the past two sessions. The School board offered this program, I
did not pay. It was communicated through the school e-mail over the winter
and I believe you get those. I don't know why the VP didn't know about it
but I can assume she joined later in the year. Their school administration
saw a lot of turnaround this past year. We were on the waitlist for a few
months and then both girls were offered a spot and we took one for
Charlotte as Alice did not want to cooperate.

Alice and Charlotte both have soccer on Saturdays from 9-11 am, Charlotte
normally speaks to you afterwards. They did not have it last week
because of the holiday and Char was sick.

Cynthia
