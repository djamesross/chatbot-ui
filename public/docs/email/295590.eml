Hi,

Both Alice and my mom=E2=80=99s birthdays are coming up, and she asked if I=E2=
=80=99d like to stay over with the girls at her place the weekend after this=
. It would be the 23rd, Saturday, after Char=E2=80=99s dance, and back Sunda=
y before or just after dinner. Would that work? The girls had a really good t=
ime there, and I thought it would work better than the weekend after.=20

Do you have plans for a kid party for Ali?=20
