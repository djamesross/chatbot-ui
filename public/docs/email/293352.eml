Hi Darryl.

Charlotte had a cold and was brought to our family doctor Monday night to
test for strep throat. The rapid test was negative. You can verify with
Arbour Family m=C3=A9decine as you have access.

As for their absent while I was away, the two girls they were staying with
had a hockey team member test positive for Covid so their mom, Michelle
asked me if that my girls should also stay home. I agreed. The family was
tested negative this past weekend and their girls have returned to school.

As for treating their separation anxiety caused by last summer=E2=80=99s in=
cident
when you collapsed while they were in your care,  on top of Charlotte
seeing a therapist which I told you about, Maureen Doyle, my mother, my
sister Kelly  and Michelle Marquis supported the girls with their feelings
while I was away.

We really do hope you will start feeling better soon and get some much
needed treatment. Your health plays a very important role in the lives of
the girls. I really hope you can get the help you need Darryl as the girls
would benefit from a healthy dad.


Alison and I look forward to seeing you December 20th.

All the best

Cynthia
