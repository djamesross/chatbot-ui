I=E2=80=99ll look for clothes this evening. I put her bag and lunch kit =
in the wash, but had to leave before they dried, so I can drop them off, =
or bring them next time I see the girls.

Also, I just wanted to let you know I haven=E2=80=99t been ignoring your =
emails, there is just a lot I have to figure out. For example I will =
probably move to save money, depending on what the case worker says. I =
meet with our CAS case worker next week (we have a new one), and then I =
think we meet with her together, but I=E2=80=99ll find out more soon.

I haven=E2=80=99t been in contact with Any in a while either. I hope we =
can work out most of this between us going forward. My only concern is =
financial matters. It might be hard for us to agree on them, but I hope =
we can try.

I=E2=80=99m meeting with Heather tomorrow morning, and hopefully I=E2=80=99=
ll know more then, and keep you up to date.
