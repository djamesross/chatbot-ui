Hi Darryl,
Sorry for my delay. I took a couple of days off last week and have been pla=
ying catch up.
I am in L'Orignal tomorrow morning for court but could chat in the afternoo=
n. I will email once I am in the office (around 2ish if all goes well).

I feel like this is good for the case, but bad for the girls, which, for me=
, means not good. They need routines and dependability, not this. (And so s=
ays Sharon!).

Can you chat tomorrow or Thursday?

Darryl
