Hi Cynthia,

I was speaking to Dr. Brenhouse who is a very acute doctor, and she
recommended a psychological consultation for Ali. And given Charlotte's
reluctance to speak with me, and your insistence that she not, I think that
Charlotte should be included as well. The girls should have the right to
talk to me without distraction or interruption. In the past, Charlotte has
always warmed up, and we've had great conversations when she didn't feel
like speaking, however this time when Ali went to see if Charlotte wanted
to, you intervened and said no. As Dr. Brenhouse notes, there is no
downside or side effect. It can only help the girls during a very stressful
time.

In terms of communication, as their parents we need to be able to
communicate whether either of us like or not, because it's about the best
interests of the girls. There's no excuse to refuse to talk to me or
completely exclude me. There has been much that has been kept from me, and
I would kindly ask that you update me on their well-being, activities, and
who is caring for them when you are unavailable.

As for medical records, neither you nor Alison are qualified to interpret
test results, notes and other medical terms. I am continuing to care for
myself and work with Dr. Brenshous and other experts who are qualified to
interpret medical tests. In the meantime, I am and remain sober and do not
use drugs. The previous court order was made with the knowledge that I was
struggling with alcohol and stipulates visitation and liberal
phone/FaceTime with the girls, so there is no reason to completely restrict
my access. I am undergoing a number of tests in February and then meeting
with Dr. Brenhouse. I am fine with giving you an update once they are done.

Darryl
