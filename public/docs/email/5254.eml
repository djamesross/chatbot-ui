&gt; Hi Darryl,<br class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; I just wanted to let you know of our schedule this weekend as it's =
a busy one with dance!!<br class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; Friday night is dress rehearsal at Algonquin, Saturday is class as =
usual. Sunday we will be dropppingC off early for the noon show and then =
the kids and I and mum are watching it together. I will have Alice on my =
lap so if you are there I;m sure she will want to sit with you.<br =
class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; Sunday evening I'm volunteering and my dad is watching the show.<br =
class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; Will you be attending with Angie?<br class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; I still have to buy the lipstick, two pairs of tights and hair =
products. I would appreciate some financial contribution towards =
this.<br class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; Also, Charlotte has been invited to tryout for MiniRoots the =
competitive team in September. I'm not sure this is realistic for us in =
terms of finances and time commitment but I wanted to give her a chance =
to try out and then go from there. So far dance has been a wonderful =
influence on her in terms of expressing her creativity, learning =
discipline and teamwork and role modeling from the older dancers. She =
will be trying out with Sophie Tuesday nights in June.<br class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; Alice really wants to take part next year and she will be of =
age.<br class=3D"">
&gt;<br class=3D"">
&gt; Cynthia<br class=3D"">
