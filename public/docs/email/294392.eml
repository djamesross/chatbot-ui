We have not spoken as I was busy when she called but I have tried her back
several times. I will need to speak to the girls and speak with Krystal
before I agree to a visit.

So today will not be a possibility.

Tmrw after school could be open as Charlotte is not taking gymnastics.
Provided I can speak to Krystal beforehand and--- you and your mother are
free.

Let me know.

Cynthia
