Hi Alison,

I hope all is well with you, and that you're weathering this lockdown well.

I'm writing for several reasons, but will try to be brief and factual,
because I don't want to trigger further anger or accusations from your
client. I have tried talking to Ms. Holmes, and have respected her demands
even when lacking grounds, in the hopes that she will eventually see that
all I want is for the girls to feel loved and secure.

Currently, they do not know where I live, as far as I know they cannot call
me without express permission, our conversations are often interrupted, and
their rights to celebrate birthdays, holidays, and have regular visits with
me have been stopped without exception or sufficient explanation.

Your client has expressed her anger with me, and has made it clear that she
does not want to communicate or see me because of her feelings, feelings
that cannot be validated because she refuses to communicate. A vicious
cycle, if ever there was one.

I hope that changes, but my primary concern is for our daughters, who do
have rights. Of their own accord, the girls have asked to see me, told me
that they miss me, and wish they could spend more time with me. It's their
feelings and rights that I see being ignored.

We agreed early on that it would benefit the girls to see a psychologist or
counsellor to help make the best decision for their well-being. Later we
agreed to bring Charlotte to Dr. Sharon Francis Harrison based on
accusations made against me. However, your client stopped treatment without
consulting or informing me, so no report was ever completed. More recently,
our family doctor recommended that Alice see a psychologist. I was never
informed, and am never informed about their well-being, except on few and
rare occasions. That has ceased completely.

Furthermore, your client banned me from her property, and during COVID it
was not possible for me to see them in public places, even while they
continued to see others. I have been told I cannot step on the property,
not even to leave a card, gift, or toy that I may have and that the girls
would like. Instead, she's demanded convoluted arrangements that entirely
prevent me from seeing my daughters. I am treated as persona non grata,
ignored and treated as though I am irrelevant to their life. This does not
bother me, but affects the girls.

In the coming days, it is both Valentine's Day and Family day, and since
your client refuses to speak to me and has told me to only communicate
through you, I am respectfully requesting that arrangements be made for
access to my daughters, but more importantly, that they be allowed to have
access to me.

I will be providing full disclosure about my financial information within
the next week. I am currently working with my family doctor, and have a
number of appointments with specialists, in order to ensure I continue to
maintain my health and sobriety. I will ensure my doctor provides the
appropriate medical information when available. This should be complete in
the next 2-3 weeks. In the meantime, I am and have maintained sobriety, so
there is no reason to delay visitation. One thing I can say as a matter of
fact is that when I was brought to the hospital last summer the blood lab
tests found no traces of alcohol, and I will ensure that is included in the
report. The agreement we made was not broken.

Based on my discussions with my doctor, specialists, including a
psychiatrist and clinical psychologist, and legal counsel, there are no
grounds for withholding access, and denying the girls their right to a
relationship with both of their parents.

I would prefer that Ms. Holmes and I communicate, but if she is unwilling
to overcome her feelings for me, based on what she's said I assume you will
communicate on her behalf.

This restriction has been incredibly difficult, and I miss my daughters
terribly. I hope to hear from you, and make arrangements without delay.

Regards,
Darryl
