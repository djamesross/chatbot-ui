I=E2=80=99ve had nothin to say to you, and will  have noting to say to you =
short of
making clear that you lied to me, knowing interfered with my children,
clearly misinformed Cynthia. If I didn=E2=80=99t care more for my children =
maybe
I=E2=80=99d be thankful that you have set her back. You meddled where you h=
ad no
right to. If you=E2=80=99re brave enough to give it a read go ahead. I don=
=E2=80=99t need a
response, because I have people that know the truth: doctors, counselors,
psychiatrists, family that love unconditionally. And an aunt who deserves
far more respect than I will ever hold for you again.



I don=E2=80=99t know what motivated you, but you need to work it out for yo=
urself.
And you can leave me out of it.

*Subject: *Final Appeal.



So I=E2=80=99m not sure how this is supposed to work given you have repeate=
dly
refused to talk, mediate or work with me in any way other than through your
lawyer, but I was advised by CAS, who as far as I know you never had a
final closing conversation with, that I should proactively be sharing
information with you. I know the courts don=E2=80=99t want to deal with thi=
s, but
the temporary order will have to be changed, and it would be best if we did
so cooperatively. That is what I ask and hope for. But I am prepared to
move forward without your conversation.



So,

   - It=E2=80=99s been over a year since I have a had any alcohol or drug
   - I have letters detailing successful progress from each of the health
   care providers I worked with that are supportive and encouraging
   - Nothing that your lawyer raised justifies this level of restriction,
   and is by the way inaccurate.
   - I did manage to see Dr. Willows, who as a policy does not see patients
   unless they are acute. It was great to see her and I asked her about the
   recommendation she made when I left the hospital. Given my progress, she
   said it is no longer relevant or applicable, and she was very happy to s=
ee
   me in good health, and does not support any restriction to ability to
   parent.
   - In case you were misled, I have not seen my sister or Kevin in over a
   year, and have had fewer than 4 phone calls with my aunt that lives in
   British Columbia. They have reasons unrelated to my ability to care for =
my
   daughters to disparage me. I would discuss the veracity of their claims
   with your lawyer, and how seriously their statements will be considered.
   - Your parents no longer supervisor, in any capacity. They merely drop
   the girls off and say see you at such and such a time. This is the case
   when my mom is present and, conveniently, at my place of work, where the
   girls enjoyed meeting coworkers and exploring the maker space I am invol=
ved
   with.
   - The girls have begun to ask questions. You have not told them
   anything, which is odd considering how insistent you were to make sure t=
hat
   they were fully informed about my alcohol abuse, as documented by Krystl=
e.
   They will continue to ask questions, because they know I am healthy, hav=
e
   time to care for them and spend with them, want to see them more. I will
   never disparage you to them. They are starting to come to their own
   conclusions.
   - I have yet to hear any safety concerns, which would be the only legal
   grounds for restricting my access.
   - On the advice of Dr. Sharon Francis Harrison I have taken pains, quiet
   literally, to not trigger you. But I do want to express concern. We have=
 an
   agreement, which CAS was party to, and it was going well as documented b=
y
   our texts and emails and time spent over the summer. Nothing changed unt=
il
   you started talking about your discomfort, not the girls, their safety, =
or
   my behaviour. I hope that you are seeking proper help.
   - The motion you are relying on to withhold the girls from me is
   temporary and will be changed. Your cooperation would be appreciated giv=
en
   how strongly the girls are expressing that they want to see me more, mis=
s
   me, and believe shared custody would be best, as we agreed to as well.
   - There is also no reason available for you to claim for yourself sole
   custody and control over the girls and my relationship with them. Again,=
 I
   encourage you to discuss with your lawyer how your decisions and actions
   will be viewed in light of the best interests of the girls.
   - I=E2=80=99m sorry piano didn=E2=80=99t work out tonight, but I=E2=80=
=99m glad they had some
   kind of practice without someone who knows how to play piano. Again, in =
the
   future I would encourage you to try to prioritize in a way that does not
   place me last, in situations that make quality time difficult or
   impossible, completely prevent me from parenting my daughters, are dicta=
ted
   contrary to the standing order, and would please ask once again that you
   arrange times with me rather than telling me when and where and for how
   long and who with I can see my daughters, for the brief transition perio=
d
   while we return to what is best for the girls.



There is now a detailed record demonstrating that you are actively
withholding custody and access from a father you described as great and in
many positive ways, who has been sober for more than 1 year, with whom you
worked with CAS toward a return to shared custody, only to provide a
changing list of justifications for denying what comes down to the girls
rights.



This has gone on far to long, but you are well aware of my financial
situation, having made it worse when you refused me access to my daughters
without cause contrary to our agreement last year in your lawyers office,
while I was still suffering addiction and without representation, and I
have hoped that we would be able to find a way through whatever it is that
has triggered your behaviour, which does display a pattern. I remain
hopeful that we can, but will be in touch with Alison by week=E2=80=99s end=
 if we
have not progressed to a reasonable transition plan to return to shared
custody. The temporary order in place is no longer applicable and will be
changed, and if you continue to deny me access and continue to control my
daughters relationship with me I am prepared to bring a motion and will be
seeking costs.



So I am putting forward a reasonable plan to transition until the order is
changed and made final. I can pick the girls up from the bus tomorrow and
spend the evening with them, and bring them back for 7. You have no reason,
past behaviour or justification to suspect me of trying to abduct them,
which I would not do for them and which would severely hurt my position if
I were foolish enough to do so. So that is no longer a matter of concern,
and in fact never was. Friday it would be great to have them spend time
with me at the college. Your parents do not and have not supervised for
months, so a simple drop off and pick up is sufficient, but if one of them
wants to sit somewhere and read a book that is fine. Sunday I have booked
tickets to see Frozen II, which we have been talking about since we first
saw the trailer and the girls, as you heard this evening, are asking and
excited to see it with me. I booked tickets for the 3:15 show, which is
usually around the time I see them. However, as part of the transition I
would like to spend more than just a the limits of the film, picking them
up earlier and having lunch with them. I think that=E2=80=99s a reasonable =
request,
fits with a transition, which they do not seem to want or need but is
probably good practice. We can agree on a pick up time after the movie,
perhaps at Indigo.



In sum, you have been withholding custody from a fully  recovered father
who met every demand you made, and then met the additional demands you
added, a father who appears to have been used as child care for the summer
while your parents were away and you showed no concern, then the girls were
suddenly denied a meaningful relationship with an active and involved
father who has proven long term sobriety, with support from multiple
doctors, counsellors and psychiatrists. Oh, and good news, my liver enzymes
are back to normal, which is both good from a health perspective and
evidence of abstinence.



I kindly ask your cooperation because this is and will be about our
daughters, and to date you have shown malice, control, and a clear attempt
to alienate me. As you, your parents, and others clearly see, they love,
are comfortable, happy, and flourish with me.



It is time to set aside your feelings toward me and focus on what is most
important.



This is my last appeal.



Darryl
