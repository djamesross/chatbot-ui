Hello,

This interferes with plans that I made based on what you communicated =
through counsel 9 days ago, what Charlotte and I discussed Thursday and =
Saturday morning, and is unfair to Alice, for whom this is also a change =
to her trip to her cousins because she is suddenly told she=E2=80=99s =
leaving early. I was looking forward to time with each of them =
individually, and they were as well. They were also expecting individual =
parenting time with me, which has been taken away from them.

The problems you=E2=80=99re having finding a way to communicate, to =
maintain some kind of routine for the girls, or to manage 2 scheduled =
visits per week is not good for the girls and is interference with my =
parenting time. These issues aren=E2=80=99t new to this decision and =
will have to be addressed. Following a schedule will reduce the need to =
communicate, directly or through counsel, so please work this out asap.

To that end the only changes to agreed parenting time, in person or =
virtual, will have to be discussed at least 1 week in advance and will =
not be changed without agreement that doing do is best for Charlotte and =
Alice.=20

When your mother has to drop Charlotte off please inform her of where =
she can stop on the street and my mom will be out to meet Charlotte. =
Please ensure that due to past events she is not welcome on the =
property. She can text or email when she is leaving or arriving.=20

Darryl
