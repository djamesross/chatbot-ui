Hi Any,

Here=E2=80=99s a new development and complication. While I was being =
drive to the police station I told the police officer (who I went to =
school with, as a coincidence), about some of the struggles I was =
having, and why I was concerned about getting back to the girls. He just =
came to to the door to ask for my insurance, which I provided, and to =
tell me that he has an obligation to call CAS about Ben going into =
Char=E2=80=99s bed. He made it clear it=E2=80=99s coming from him, as an =
obligation as part of his job, and that it is not a complaint from me.

Not sure how this is going to play=E2=80=A6
