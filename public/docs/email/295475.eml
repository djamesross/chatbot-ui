Yes, she said the same thing to me. I just talked to Todd and only mornings w=
ork for them - like 9-11, 10-12, or 11-1.=20

Would any is those work for you?

I=E2=80=99m going to meet with Angie soon, and hopefully set a regular time s=
o we meet the three times a week.

I really appreciate your patience. I know it=E2=80=99s been hard for you. Fo=
r me, It=E2=80=99s been hard with the strike, and trying to find a cheaper p=
lace that is =E2=80=98decent=E2=80=99. I have found a place and will be able=
 to help out soon.=20

The colleges have agreed to mediation, and I don=E2=80=99t think this will g=
o on past next week.=20

I want them to be in activities, and to help as much as I can. I=E2=80=99ll b=
e able to do more and more. With a cheaper place, and extra work (I=E2=80=99=
m looking for part-time work), I=E2=80=99ll be able to help more.=20

Also, it was so nice to see Ben. That=E2=80=99s a whole other conversation, I=
=E2=80=99m sure, but I really miss the boys. I would love to be a positive p=
art of their life. Ben asked to do something, and I said I=E2=80=99d like to=
, but you need to make the decision. (I understand if you want to put that c=
onversation aside for a while).=20

As for benefits, I=E2=80=99m not getting any, and I spoke to CRA 5-6 weeks a=
go.

I=E2=80=99ll call them again to make sure.=20
