Yes, I'll need the towels. Their hats may still be packed so please bring
those as well, but I have sunscreen, bug spray, water, and snacks so
they'll be well taken care of. I also have some activities and games if
they would like to play them.

We can meet at the usual spot in the parking lot in front of the
playground.

Darryl
