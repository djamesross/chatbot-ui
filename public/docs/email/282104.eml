As it stands, I don't think they are safe or well cared for with you. You ha=
ve done nothing to explain your behaviour, expressed regret or try to seek t=
reatment. Additionally you haven't signed consent for Child Services to rele=
ase your file or for CAS to speak to The girls caregiver and teacher. This a=
ll worries me.=20

My mom mentioned you have a work meeting at Algonquin. Are you back at work?=
 Normally at this time of year you are no longer working until Mid August.
