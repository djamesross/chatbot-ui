School - I stopped by the school this morning to see if Charlotte was =
there (but not to see her - or at least not for her to see me). I was =
told by the principle that Cyn called Monday to let them know that she =
was keeping Charlotte home for a couple of days because of family =
problems. I don=E2=80=99t know if Cyn ended up taking her in today.
