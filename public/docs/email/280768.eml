I don't know what " ualiry" means.

Darryl, as long as you appear healthy and of present mind I am happy for
you to visit the girls. I will check in with you at the beginning of the
visit to make sure you are well, I will be polite as always and will keep
my distance so you three can enjoy each other's company.

I have some bathing towels from your old place that I will bring for the
girls, sunscreen, hats and water. You can take the towels home with you.

Cynthia
