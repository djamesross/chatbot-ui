I saved a possible response in your drafts folder. If we want to go =
ahead I think we need to make it clear that we're going ahead based on =
professional opinion and evidence, not personal feelings. So I wrote =
that exactly.

Before we send him the contact info I think we should email Dr. Cebulski =
& Heather, and I'd like to talk to Dr. Fraser on the phone. Let's not =
give him heather's last name - let him find it or ask us for it to show =
how uninvolved he's been.
