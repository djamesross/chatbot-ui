Hi,

Your name was given to us by Heather Gilman at Churchill. Our oldest son =
is currently in her class, and we (Heather, my wife and I) have noticed =
that he is struggling in class in some ways that may indicate attention =
deficits. We are going to have him assessed, and are interested in your =
services.

We can be reached at 613-695-7767. You can speak to me or my wife - =
Darryl or Cynthia.

Best,
Darryl=
