Hi Cynthia,

What I received from your mom was just Char's evaluation. There is no =
request for a letter, or description. I=E2=80=99ve checked the website, =
but I=E2=80=99m still not sure what is expected in the letter: is it =
just a special message of encouragement? Do we talk about her qualities, =
dreams, efforts? Can you give me a little more information?

Also, we=E2=80=99ve just been told that we are going back to work =
tomorrow and have a college-wide meeting at 8 am, and are expected to be =
there early. Can I drop off the letter to you tonight, so you can send =
it with Char?

Darryl
