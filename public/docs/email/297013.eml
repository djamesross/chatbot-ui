Hi Any,

Cynthia seems to have stopped communicating with me. She hasn't responded to=
 messages about about care for girls for the summer (since Saturday). She ig=
nored my messages about this week, and left me expecting the girls Monday mo=
rning. Without telling me, on Monday, she left Alice at Laura's and kept Cha=
r home for a 'special' day: she told Laura that Char was sick, but took Char=
 shopping for jewelry, to Ben's school, to Ikea, and swimming at a neighbors=
 pool. She sent me no messages. I only knew too pick Char up at Laura's (Ali=
ce's caregiver) because Laura told me - Cynthia sent me no messages.=20

I feel like this is good for the case, but bad for the girls, which, for me,=
 means not good. They need routines and dependability, not this. (And so say=
s Sharon!).

Can you chat tomorrow or Thursday?

Darryl=
