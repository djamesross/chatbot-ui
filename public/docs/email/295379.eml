I don't really care that you are not comfortable - you have given no explana=
tion or reason - I could say the same thing to you - that I'm not comfortabl=
e with you having my boys as much as you do !!

As for the Tuesday nights you offered to help when I was in a pinch with veh=
icles - would you like me to send you your email back to you ?=20

And I had sent subsequent emails stating that I was working on it - and then=
 1 stating that I had resolved the car issue ! It is so funny how you latche=
d on to the very first email ! Ha ... You are really showing your true color=
s.

Have a great day=20
