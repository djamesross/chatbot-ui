Hi Darryl,

Thank you for your feedback.  I revised the first part of the letter and
included it below.  Let me know if you would like to make any further
changes or additions.

*Good afternoon Ms. Boyce,*

*I am writing to provide information about Mr. Ross=E2=80=99 new residence =
and to
raise some concerns which have arisen.*

*New address*




*Mr. Ross moved on May 1, 2022, and his new address is 1266 Marygrove Cir.,
Nepean, ON, K2C 2C9 *

*Vacation for children in June, 2022*

*Mr. Ross has learned that your client has already booked a vacation for
the children without first discussing it with him or providing any details
about the vacation which will impact his parenting time.  We understand
that your client first booked a trip to Calgary in June for herself,
Charlotte and Alice, prior to the end of the school year.  *

*Why would your client book a trip prior to the hearing of the motion in
March 2022, for before the end of the school year in June 2022?*

*We understand that the intention of the trip is to spend time with her
boyfriend who lives in Calgary. Mr. Ross is concerned that your client
intends on moving to Calgary with Charlotte and Alice.  Please advise if
this is her intention.*

*The fact that your client made and then cancelled plans with his family,
indicating to them that they are now flying into Calgary and then flying to
Saskatoon for an indeterminate length of time has heightened his concerns. =
*

*Would you please have your client provide particulars about the trip with
Charlotte and Alice, including but not limited to the date of departure,
where they will be staying, and when they will be returning.  A copy of
their plan tickets is also requested.  *

*What is your client=E2=80=99s plan for parenting time when the children in=
tents to
be away with the children?*

*Mr. Ross=E2=80=99 right to information about Charlotte and Alice/joint
decision-making*

*On May 11, 2022, Mr. Ross sent an email to your client requesting
information about Charlotte and Alice=E2=80=99s missed school days, their h=
ealth
and to update me him anything else of importance.  His request has not been
answered.  Would you please speak to your client about this issue as Mr.
Ross has a right to receive information about the children, and you client
cannot continue to make unilateral decisions about the health and well
being of the children.  In fact, the parties still have joint custody, and
decisions pertaining to the children are to be made jointly and not
unilaterally by Ms. Holmes.*

*Parenting time with Charlotte and Alice*

*Mr. Ross continues to insist that there is no reason that he cannot have
in person parenting time with the children.  Your client continues to
refuse his in-person parenting time.  Although she recently offered some
virtual FaceTime for Mr. Ross to have with the children, those times have
been cancelled frequently, and they are irregular.  Given the comments made
by Justice Somji, and pending her decision, we expected that your client
would move forward with establishing regular parenting time with the
children.  Would you please speak to your client about this issue so that
we can establish a regular parenting schedule, in the best interest of the
children?*

*We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest opportunity.*

*Regards,*

*Allison Lendor*
