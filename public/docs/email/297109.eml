Hi Any,

During our meeting Heather confirmed the following:
- at this time, the investigation is focused on my caregiver capacity, =
because of allegations of mental illness and alcohol consumption, but =
there are no safety concerns, and no reasons to restrict access
- after consulting with CHEO and the Ottawa Police, meeting with =
Cynthia, and spending time with Charlotte, the  investigation is not =
looking into accusations of sexual assault (the accusation does not meet =
their eligibility criteria - there is an utter lack of evidence)
- CAS has no reason to intervene in the motion before Family Court. =
There is no "information to verify concerns=E2=80=9D, and there are no =
safety concerns

That said, it will take time to close the case. She wants to talk to a =
few people that are close to me to verify that there are no concerns =
related to mental illness or alcohol consumption. But again, to be =
clear, at present there are no safety concerns, they are not proceeding =
with the investigation of allegations of sexual assault, and she sees no =
reason to restrict my access to the girls.

Here are a few more interesting points. While Cynthia says she was =
=E2=80=9Cprompted=E2=80=9D by CAS to take Charlotte to CHEO (par. 8.), =
Heather says that she was asked by Cynthia if she should have Charlotte =
examined at CHEO. Heather says that Cynthia had taken  Charlotte to CHEO =
to have a rash examined - not for sexual assault - and that once there, =
when Cynthia asked her if she should have her examined for signs of =
sexual assault, Heather told her it=E2=80=99s an option - she neither =
encouraged her to, nor discouraged her to. Cynthia actually asked =
Heather on the phone from CHEO - so she was already there.

The first call that was made to CAS on the Friday was exclusively about =
Ben, and Cynthia=E2=80=99s accusation that I caused him emotional =
distress. It was not about Charlotte or sexual assault. I=E2=80=99ve =
asked Heather to follow up with me and let me know when (date & time) =
the first call to CAS was made, and when Cynthia raised concerns about =
sexual assault. (She said that she did not hear about Charlotte on the =
Friday in question, but will check to see if Cynthia spoke to anyone =
else.)

I can=E2=80=99t believe how many holes, distortions and flat-out lies =
there are in her affidavit! When I showed Heather what Cynthia had =
written in paragraph 8., she made a note and said that she would have to =
speak to Cynthia about it.

Dr. James asked me to come in to her office to sign a different release =
form - one that includes more information about informed consent. I=E2=80=99=
m going to do that at 1 pm (unless I hear otherwise from you). While =
there, I=E2=80=99m going to ask her a few more questions relating to =
Cynthia=E2=80=99s fears of sexual assault.
