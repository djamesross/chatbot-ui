Hi Darryl,

I just wanted to let you know of our schedule this weekend as it's a busy
one with dance!!

Friday night is dress rehearsal at Algonquin, Saturday is class as usual.
Sunday we will be dropppingC off early for the noon show and then the kids
and I and mum are watching it together. I will have Alice on my lap so if
you are there I;m sure she will want to sit with you.

Sunday evening I'm volunteering and my dad is watching the show.

Will you be attending with Angie?

I still have to buy the lipstick, two pairs of tights and hair products. I
would appreciate some financial contribution towards this.

Also, Charlotte has been invited to tryout for MiniRoots the competitive
team in September. I'm not sure this is realistic for us in terms of
finances and time commitment but I wanted to give her a chance to try out
and then go from there. So far dance has been a wonderful influence on her
in terms of expressing her creativity, learning discipline and teamwork and
role modeling from the older dancers. She will be trying out with Sophie
Tuesday nights in June.

Alice really wants to take part next year and she will be of age.

Cynthia
