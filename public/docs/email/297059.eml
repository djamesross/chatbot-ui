Hi Denyse,

Thanks for the explanation. We did agree to have it listed =E2=80=98early =
January=E2=80=99, so I think we=E2=80=99re still on track. I=E2=80=99m =
meeting with two realtors tomorrow morning, and then I told Cynthia I =
would contact her and we would decided on which one we are planning to =
use.=20

I do have a few questions - are you free to chat? If so, I can be =
reached at 613-762-2067

Darryl
