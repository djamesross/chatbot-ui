div><p class=3DMsoNormal>I am sorry to hear that the situation is deteriora=

ccess to their school reports and can you talk directly with their teachers=
? If possible, I would suggest that without implying anything negative, you=
 approach their teachers to ask about their observations of the girls. Do t=
hey seem happy? &nbsp;Do they have friends? Are they progressing as expecte=
d? You can ask these questions as an interested parent (not based on any co=
ncerns). &nbsp;If the teachers have concerns, the next step may involve spe=
aking with the principal and trying to arrange for a joint parent conferenc=
e. &nbsp;The whole point is to have object third parties who have direct ob=
servations of your children and who would also be able to observe if Cynthi=
a is acting in their best interest. &nbsp;Having third party involvement sh=
ould help Cynthia to be focused on the girls' well being. &nbsp;Due to the =
conflict between you, it would likely be best that Cynthia not know that yo=
