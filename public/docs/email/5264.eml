I spoke to her yesterday and she explained. She also explained its important=
 we=E2=80=99re on the same page, for the girls. Contradicting explanations w=
ill hurt their trust, and based on what you=E2=80=99ve written to me, and si=
nce you have not asked, I will email you later this afternoon and let you kn=
ow why I was actually in the hospital, and what the doctors believe caused m=
