Alice has been talking about discomfort that is like a UTII but is not, and
that she has a follow up appointment. Please let me know the details,
including any treatment plans. As you know she has had repealed UTIs, we
requested an ultrasound to rule out internal issues. Ultrasound came back
normal. We will return to the doctor this week to see if she has a vaginal
infection. Dr. Brenhouse and her associates have been educating Alice on
proper wiping, hygiene and creams to apply. It's been an ongoing issue and
we are still working on it.

Also, can you provide details about what happened to Charlotte when she was
home on April 6 and injured herself after following a TikTok video that
teaches you how to make yourself faint, including whether she was taken to
a doctor.
As you know from Charlotte she did faint and hit her head as she fell, it
was a scary experience for her and I. I understand she told you as well. I
monitored Charlotte for a few days and felt she did not suffer any head
trauma that needed medical attention. She was responsive, able to move and
experienced no signs of a head injury that required medical attention. We
have spoken at length about the dangers of social media and how to best
protect herself. We also deleted tik tok from her phone. I am confident
Charlotte has learned a hard lesson from this one and we are both moving on=
.
