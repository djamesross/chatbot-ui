Thank you for getting back so quickly! I know you are busy.

Holly is my mom. I am absolutely unwilling to go to her house. She has a =
history of making accusations and it is further complicated because of =
her sons, my former step sons.

I=E2=80=99ve written the following which I will send unless I hear =
otherwise.

Thank you again Jane,

Darryl

Without Prejudice,

At no point during a visit was supervision necessary. I never intended =
to abscond with my daughters and I never indicated to anyone that I =
considered doing so or would consider doing so. My behaviour clearly =
demonstrates that I will not. In addition, the supervisors that you =
chose demonstrated no concern that I would on any occasion, including =
during the following:
September 2nd, Green Park: I walked unescorted and out of sight through =
the wooded path on two occasions each no less than 30 minutes, while =
your mother remained seated on a bench facing the opposite direction. =
When your mother informed me she was taking the girls she said that she =
would go ahead to the car and leave me get the girls ready and bring =
them over the hill to the car.
September 11, Kilbernie Park: I walked my daughters over the hill and =
out of sight and without an escort to the washroom while your mom =
remained on a bench reading. We were out of sight for no less than 20 =
minutes. Again, when your mother informed me she was taking the girls =
she said that she would go ahead to the car and leave me get the girls =
ready and bring them over the hill to the car.
September 17, Kilbernie Park: I walked my daughter over the hill and out =
of sight and without an escort to the washroom. My other daughter =
followed us. We chased a cricket into the field, also out of sight of =
your mother for no less than 30 minutes. Once again your mother went =
ahead to the car, out of sight, leaving me to bring the girls to her =
car.
September 21, Greenbank Park: I arrived at the park and the girls ran to =
hug me. Your stepfather remained in the distance on a bench for =
approximately 30 minutes at which point the girls asked where he went. =
We realized that he went to his car, which was not visible from where we =
were much of the time. He remained there for approximately 1 hour.
Despite my disagreement I have cooperated because it is the only way =
that I can see my daughters right now and I will continue to cooperate =
until a reasonable schedule is established. Forcing a supervised access =
sight is not in the interest of Charlotte or Alice.

Visitation in your home is inappropriate and unreasonable.

I will remain available to meet at Ken Ross Park this afternoon or =
another neutral location in the nieghtborhood. While I continue to =
disagree with your restrictions I want very much to see my daughters and =
will not take them or prevent them from leaving.
