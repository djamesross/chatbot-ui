Also, Todd and Cindy are still settling in, but I think next weekend =
will work. I don=E2=80=99t know about the time though, so I asked them =
what times would work, and hopefully we can find a time that works for =
all of us (but that time might work - I=E2=80=99ll let you know). Also, =
I=E2=80=99m hoping to set up something with Angie. We=E2=80=99re going =
to meet this week, and I=E2=80=99ll ask her if she can supervise. It =
would be good to set up regular FaceTime chats on the days I don=E2=80=99t=
 see them. I know Tuesday=E2=80=99s don=E2=80=99t work, but once we =
figure out visits we can figure that out.

I=E2=80=99ll let you know, and try to keep better contact.
