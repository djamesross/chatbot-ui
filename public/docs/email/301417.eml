Bonjour M. Giroux,

I spoke to both Mme Nadia and Mme Lisa today. It was great to speak with =
both of them and to learn about Charlotte and Alice=E2=80=99s progress. =
Mme Lisa is going to send me information on how to follow Alice=E2=80=99s =
work and progress online. Mme Nadia told me that she is going to look =
into it. When I looked at the contact information for Charlotte it still =
states that I do not have legal custody, and I am concerned this is =
creating a barrier to supporting her education.

Please update Charlotte=E2=80=99s contact information and ensure that =
Mme Nadia is able to allow me access to Charlotte=E2=80=99s google =
classroom and online content so that I can follow her progress and =
support her learning, as well as adding me as a guardian in both their =
Google Classrooms.

Merci et bonne journ=C3=A9e,

Darryl Ross.
