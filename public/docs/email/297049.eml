Hi Any,

We've got a low offer, 20k less than we agreed to list for. It's the first o=
ffer, and we've only been showing the house doe 3 days.=20

If we average the price given by the three real estate agents, it's about 54=
6k. We're listed at 550k. Cynthia is pushing to sell at 530k. I don't agree,=
 and don't want to accept the deal (maybe in 3-4 weeks, but not yet).=20

But she's also stated that she won't pay half the mortgage after Feb. 18. I t=
hink she means whether it's sold or not.=20

Her email is below. Please let me know what you think.=20

Darryl
