It's getting late and I would really like to be able to speak to my
daughters.

And as for tomorrow you have told me I can't see them except and unless I
follow your direct demands, but that was a late and rash decision, so I
hope strongly that you will not tell me the time has changed now too, less
than a day before I have arranged my life. Which by the way was centered
around the girls and plans set in place and agreed upon.
