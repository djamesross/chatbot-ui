I'm  sorry you're making this so difficult, and are intent on foreign me to
bring a motion.

CenterPoint library is the least worst of the unnecessary options, so let's
do with that. I don't think it's good to force me to see them at a store
full of toys on a regular basis and hope you can recognize that as well.

I wold also remind you that point custody remains so ignoring me sends a
clear message.
