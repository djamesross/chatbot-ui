I=E2=80=99m glad you=E2=80=99re reconsidering. Again, there are pros and =
cons, but I agree the consistency will be better for them.=20

I was also wondering about switch times. I=E2=80=99ve done the math, and =
to maintain 50-50, it looks like the switch on the first Saturday should =
be in the morning (from you to me), and the switch on the second Sunday =
at noon, or just before Ali=E2=80=99s nap. (Or it could be the reverse.)

That seems to be the best way to ensure we both have equal time with =
them, but I=E2=80=99m open to suggestions.
