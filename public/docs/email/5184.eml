Without Prejuduidice,

I do not need supervision or interference with my right to parent my
daughters, and I vehemently disagree with the restrictions you are forcing
on me and especially the girls.

However, since this is the only way I can see them I will accept with
protest.

I will be at the college marking midterms, and the girls really enjoyed
being able to play outside of the library, which would be an ideal spot.
