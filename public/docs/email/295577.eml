Hi Cynthia,

I really appreciate your cooperation today, allowing Charlotte, my mom and
I and to have some special time, limited though it was. Generous by 90% of
people they will not see this, but at least you did not completely cancel
Charlotte's birthday this year. Last year was very depressing for
Charlotte's should you have noticed.

I have to say that at the park while it was nice that you give me the
correct time which deviates from the modus operandi that goes back as far
as Scott, which was always to ensure that the children see as little as
their father as possible. So receiving a text was greatly appreciated,
though it's hard not to see it as make up for last week in which you knew
days ahead that the game was changed and yet failed to notify me. This
merely adds to the pattern, which is well documented. That said I do hope
that this increase in communication and Corporation will continue with
those in need for court. However, these are my daughters, I have learned a
lot what's the legal system, and have a series of patterns well documented.
put why don't we instead increase our communication which will do nothing
more than benefit the girls? Call me na=C3=AFve, but to avoid it will do no=
thing
more than benefit the girls.

I do have to make a note of one utterly unnecessary comment made directly
in front of Charlotte after she told me with excitement about Alice's
haircut. There was no need to use that tone and to make certain that
Charlotte knew you had to cut Alice=E2=80=99s hair because you could not af=
ford to
have her hair cut professionally. You have taken almost every step you can
to exclude me from the girl's life including taking them to the dentist and
having the money submitted to my account without notifying me when putting
me in overdraft. We are no longer a couple, we no longer share financial
information, and so you do not know when my bills will come out, or when I
pay rent or what my financial situation is other than that it is horrible.

I can't read your mind, but one would assume that it frustrates you, and
that has nothing to do with me. I have clarified that I will pay you back
as soon as I can and I have taken steps to ensure that situation will not
happen again. I have also taken steps to ensure that you will not go around
me, and tried to deal with my insurance without my knowledge, my bank
accounts, or what my living condition is.The tone and your comment, which
clarified that you are very unhappy about your financial situation, should
never be discussed in front of either of the girls ever.

Please save your anger for me, when the girls are not around. I=E2=80=99ve =
learned
to deal with it. TheY should not.

Darryl
