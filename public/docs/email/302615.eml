Hi Darryl,

The girls can come to your place from 1-330pm. Dennis can=E2=80=99t last for=
 much longer ... visits can be longer once I meet the family you are staying=
 with and feel comfortable leaving the girls there.

Also can you explain all the cameras in their home? I am not comfortable wit=
h the girls being filmed.

Thanks.

Cynthia=20

See you at 1 pm.
