Confidential & Without Prejudice,

To be clear, there is absolutely no reason to force restricted and =
supervised access to my children and my parenting time. Restricted =
supervised visitation does not benefit my children. Furthermore, and =
following from the last standing court order, I am not in agreement or =
comfortable with the supervisor you have chosen. I am accepting on a =
without prejudice basis only because you refuse to communicate, provide =
information, or accept the terms of the court order.

I will pack a picnic for me and the girls, and be at the park before =
11:30.

Because you are restricting access to less than 0.036% of the week, =
please ensure that your supervisor knows exactly where the park is. On =
google maps it is called Greenbank park, and it is directly across from =
Food Basics at 900 Greenback rd. The location can be found on Google =
Maps at the following link: =
