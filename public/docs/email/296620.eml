 which I would not do for them and which would severely hurt my position if=
 I were foolish enough to do so. So that is no longer a matter of concern, =
and in fact never was. Friday it would be great to have them spend time wit=
h me at the college. Your parents do not and have not supervised for months=
, so a simple drop off and pick up is sufficient, but if one of them wants =
to sit somewhere and read a book that is fine. Sunday I have booked tickets=
 to see Frozen II, which we have been talking about since we first saw the =
trailer and the girls, as you heard this evening, are asking and excited to=
 see it with me. I booked tickets for the 3:15 show, which is usually aroun=
d the time I see them. However, as part of the transition I would like to s=
pend more than just a the limits of the film, picking them up earlier and h=
aving lunch with them. I think that=E2=80=99s a reasonable request, fits wi=
th a transition, which they do not seem to want or need but is probably goo=
