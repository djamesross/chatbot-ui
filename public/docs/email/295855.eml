Sorry, but I haven't had any alcohol. You might have smelt mouthwash, or iso=
propyl alcohol, which I put on my feet each morning (foot odour, unfortunate=
ly), but is poisonous if ingested).

I'm afraid you're looking for something that just isn't there. Besides which=
, it was 8:23 in the morning, and I was on the phone, and barely interacted w=
ith you. =20

I always have and will continue to care for the girls, sober and alert. Ther=
e is nothing more important to me than their well-being, and it would be goo=
d to build on that.=20
