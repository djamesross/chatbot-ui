Thanks for the text. I have some thoughts on your recovery.

First of all, I am very happy that the visits are going well with the
girls, they feel loved, and safe which is the most important. I appreciate
that we have made these  consistent and that you give them your full
attention. I see this as a positive change and a step in the right
direction.

To be honest, yes there are still many hills to climb before I am a
comfortable sharing parenting on a full time basis. I need to see that you
are able to be responsible in your financial commitments, committed to your
health and ideally have developed a stronger support network that extends
pass just your mother.

In terms of health commitment,  am concerned that you have not received
addictions treatment after your visit to ICU and that you have not followed
the recommendation of your past addiction counsellor. It concerns me that
you are not accepting responsibility of your actions and getting the help
that you need. I want to see you seek treatment.

It also concerns me that you were not honest with myself, my family and CAS
as to why you were in ICU and that it was due to your drinking. This is an
ongoing area of concern for me that you have not accepted full
responsibility of your addiction issue and that you are not being honest
with yourself or others. The issue of trust is a big one for me.

I think the visits are going well and the girls feel loved and safe with
you and until I can see some changes in the area I listed above I am
comfortable keeping things status quo.

As for the summer, I have planned some camps and trips but I am flexible
with having a day a week with you in lieu of camp and to keep Sundays.

I know this may be hard things to hear and that you are very focused on
wanting the girls back full time. I do want this too I but this a slower
process than expected and I think you need to make some change to your
overall health before we go any further.



Cynthia
