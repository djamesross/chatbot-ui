Any,

I just spent the most enjoyable five and a half hours of my life. The =
girls ran into the house and into my arms, and we spent the entire time =
playing, cuddling, wrestling, laughing, and chatting=E2=80=A6 We =
painted, raced around the house, dressed up in costumes, ate yummy food. =
It was bliss.=20

But saying goodbye to them, and giving them back to their mother, was =
unbearable. Charlotte started to cry as soon as it was time to go. =
She=E2=80=99s a strong one, and tried not to cry, but started to sob at =
the door. As soon as Cynthia told Alice it was time to go she backed =
away and began to yell. They did not want to go to their mother, and =
they never have. I held Charlotte, crying, in my arms, while Cynthia put =
Alice in the car. Alice screamed the entire time. And then I had to pass =
Charlotte to Cynthia, and as they walked away I had to watch Charlotte =
sob, calling for me. And she had to watch me stand at the door and do =
nothing. That=E2=80=99s the part that hurts so much - they have to see =
me do nothing for them.

I did break down at one point and cried, while I was holding Charlotte. =
But I managed to pull myself together to say goodbye to her as I passed =
her to Cynthia. And now I feel like I just ripped out the most important =
part of myself and gave it to a person who is trying to hurt me.

I don=E2=80=99t know if I can give them back to her again. Maybe I can =
do it once more, maybe twice. But I can=E2=80=99t do that to them, to =
their trust, and to their faith in me as a parent, much longer.

I need my girls back, and they need me.

There are a few things today that might support our case:
- when Cynthia came to drop off the girls, she never checked to see if =
Todd and Cindy were in the house. She had emailed them, and their truck =
was in the driveway, but she never actually saw them or spoke to them, =
and they can confirm that
- when Cynthia dropped the girls off she gave me no instructions, and =
she did not ask about alcohol. She didn=E2=80=99t say that only Cindy =
could take Charlotte to the washroom, or change Alice, or that Cindy had =
to be in the room when I put Alice down for her nap
- and she dropped Charlotte off wearing a summer dress. Seriously, a =
light summer dress, with panties. No leggings, not tights, nothing. I =
noticed it, my sister noticed it, and Cindy noticed it. That is not how =
you should dress a four year old in November in Canada, and it is NOT =
how you dress a four year that you believe is being molested by her =
father, which she goes to visit him (however it is how she often =
dresses, and it is one of her favourites).

And finally, a few more things I came across today, when I was reviewing =
all my notes:
- the morning of November 6th, when Cynthia was supposed to come home to =
take the girls to school, but texted to say that she was driving the =
boys to school, she paid $56 at a local restaurant (I=E2=80=99m assuming =
she took the boys for brunch before dropping them off at school, because =
the payment was made at about 8:45 am, and Sam=E2=80=99s school starts =
shortly after 9 am)
- the afternoon of November 6th, Cynthia made two purchases at The =
Source (an electronics store - which is odd for her), at approx. 2:39 =
p.m. Since I dropped her off at her mother=E2=80=99s after our =
appointment with Dr. James, at approximately 1:30 pm, she must have gone =
to the source after, according to her sworn affidavit, she =
=E2=80=9Cimmediately began thinking about Mr. Ross=E2=80=99s strange =
behaviour and his relationship with the girls=E2=80=9D, and after the =
CAS apparently told her to =E2=80=9Cstay with my girls and not to leave =
them alone with Mr. Ross,=E2=80=9D advice that she claims she followed.

I think the last bit is particularly important, because it fills out her =
timeline for Friday. The following is based on her affidavit, and our =
banking records:
- I drop her at her mom=E2=80=99s at about 1:30 pm. She talks to her =
mom, and starts to wonder if I=E2=80=99m a pedophile. She calls CAS, and =
is told not to leave me alone with the girls - instructions which she =
says she followed
BUT
- at 2:39 p.m. she makes two purchases at The Source (confirmed by the =
bank)
- at 4:59 p.m. she makes a purchase at a grocery store near our house =
(confirmed by the bank)
- she arrives home at approximately 5:15 pm (confirmed by audio =
recording)

I don=E2=80=99t know what she did between 2:39 pm, and the time she =
makes the purchase at the grocery store, which is roughly two hours =
later, including the time it would take her to shop and line-up. But she =
was not present at the house when the either of the boys came home, or =
when they were picked up by their dad at 4:30 pm, or when I picked up =
the girls at 3:40 pm, and took them home.
