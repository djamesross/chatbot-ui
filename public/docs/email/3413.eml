Hi Cynthia,

Unfortunately I could not send emails yesterday and so you may not have =
received my response.=20

Please confirm your agreement with the parenting schedule of Tuesdays =
4-7 pm and Sundays 1- 5 pm, and FaceTime Thursday afternoon and Saturday =
morning at 10 am.

I believe it is important to be clear about issues like illness and what =
constitutes being too sick for parenting time. I am more than capable of =
caring for them when they are not feeling well, and unless she was =
unable to leave her bed or travel by car, and a doctor=E2=80=99s =
appointment is made or she needs to go to the hospital, schedule =
parenting time should continue. Alice is certainly not feeling well, but =
I do not agree that yesterday=E2=80=99s parenting time should have been =
cancelled.=20

If one or both of them is sick as their father I should be able to =
FaceTime them to see how they are doing, or they should be allowed to =
FaceTime me. Parenting time includes the right to information about =
health and well-being.=20

Going forward, If it is agreed that one of them is too sick scheduled =
parenting time with the other should not be cancelled as well. My mom =
could have picked Charlotte up and brought her here.

Please confirm with me by 1 pm tomorrow whether or not you agreed with =
the schedule, how we will handle the issue of illness in the future, and =
tomorrow=E2=80=99s visit from 4-7 pm.

Thank you,

Darryl
