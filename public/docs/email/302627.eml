Hi Linda,

I hope you and Dennis had a good summer in Saskatoon. You certainly =
missed a lot of humidity.

Cynthia let me know that you are watching the girls for the next couple =
of weeks, and to check with you about time with them. I=E2=80=99m =
available most days and would love to spend time with them. If you want =
to plan a few dates, or if you need to run errands or want some down =
time, let me know. Even on short notice I=E2=80=99m usually available. I =
can always take them to the park or for a bike ride.

Hope all is well,

Darryl=
