 I too, think the girls should split time between both parents, when the par=
ents are both healthy. You are not healthy Darryl and you haven't shown any s=
igns to me to try to get the help to get healthy. I hope you do for the girl=
s' sake. So for now I will continue to do my best to make sure they connect w=
ith you, by family visits, calls, and FaceTime.=20

Charlotte's tummy and head she's are definitely concerning. She gets them ri=
ght after and before she sees you. It really concerns me that she doesn't wa=
nt to see you. That's is hard, especially since you two were close.=20
