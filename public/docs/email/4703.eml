Hi Cynthia,

I was in ICU for 2 nights, then at my mom=E2=80=99s until yesterday. Someho=
w I
managed to lock my iPhone and iPad so it=E2=80=99s been hard to communicate=
 or know
what=E2=80=99s been said.

I am doing well health wise, but in all honesty the full extent of my life
is hitting me, and it is hard emotionally. I am going to get a referral for
CBT and a counsellor to deal with  the stress and loneliness and guilt I
feel, especially for the girls. I miss them terribly. Can you let me know
what they=E2=80=99ve been told, and if they are available To talk this even=
ing?

I spoke to my former abdications counsellor and she recommended that it is
the grief and loneliness I need help with, and that alcohol is a symptom. I
am no longer drinking, and since alcohol acted as a medication for anxiety
it is a struggle, but one that I am going to focus on in counselling.

My counsellor encouraged me to just be honest with you, and let you know
that you can help by communicating more, which would help me, but primarily
the girls, who may be confused and concerned.

Darryl
