Hi Cynthia,

I am writing to plan a time to make up the 6 hours of parenting time for =
this past Sunday. The girls have soccer Sundays until 12:30 and my mom =
isn=E2=80=99t available earlier so it=E2=80=99s not possible to extend =
Sunday which leaves Saturday. My mom is available during the day until =
4:30 pm. Saturday morning 10-4 or 10:30-4:30 pm works for us as make up =
time.=20

Please let me know if the the girls are available.

Darryl
