I returned them. I thought it best to avoid the drama right now, and see =
how today goes.

I think I=E2=80=99m set, but I=E2=80=99ve been thinking about the police =
report Alison got. Would Heather definitely have access to it? Also, =
there are a few errors in it.=20

I just hope there aren=E2=80=99t more allegations.
