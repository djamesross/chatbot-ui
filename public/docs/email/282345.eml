Hi Darryl,
I did not agree with you having the girls in your care at your home alone.
I did not lay out that condition as you gave me the impression you would be
at Cindy's party the whole time. I was under the impression that once you
confirmed Todd was driving, and picking them up at 130 pm, you would be at
the party the whole time and that he would drop them off.me.

I have the texts and e-mails too.

I was hopeful on Sunday that we were making progress and that you were
taking my concerns seriously. My trust is again shaken because you kept the
girls alone at your home without my permission.

As I've always stated, I will agree for you to spend some time with the
girls with family or a neutral party, for you not to drink and for the
girls to sleep at my place. I want Charlotte and Alice to spend time with
you Darryl.  I believe some more legal mediation at this point will help.

Can we start to negotiate some supervised time with your family? I'm
flexible with dates and times depending on their schedule. I want to make
this work for the best interest of the girls.

Cynthia
