Hi Darryl,

The main reason is as follows, you are not properly set up to have the
girls part time, they are getting older and its no longer suitable to have
them share a room with you for an extended period of time. My lawyer agrees=
.

As I stated before, I did speak to the girls about this change and how they
felt about it. Again they were happy and comfortable with this decision.

If you would like to discuss this further, I would ask that you contact my
lawyer directly.

Cynthia
