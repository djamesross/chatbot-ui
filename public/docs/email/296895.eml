Hi Any,

I met with Will, and it's not good, but not worse than I expected. He can't s=
hare the police report - it's a condition from the crown. I called the Ottaw=
a Police and talked to a constable from the Freedom of Information section a=
nd she said I can't even get the full disclosure. And moreover, she said Ali=
son probably should not have been given what she got. (She encouraged me to s=
end the documents to her supervisor so they can investigate, but I don't car=
e to get someone else in trouble right now.)

So Will can't share the disclosure, but he said - and yelled - the only thin=
g that matters are the transcripts and plea. If I agree it'll be 2-3 weeks, a=
nd I can order rush transcripts.=20

As for the plea, the crown has offered the following, which he thinks I shou=
ld accept: I plea to leaving the scene (criminal charge), and driving impair=
ed (criminal charge), I lose my license for 12 months, and I pay a substanti=
al fine. The crown will drop the refusal to supply a blood sample charge. In=
 court they'll read the charges, which includes an eye-witness account of me=
 swerving, hitting the car, and leaving. He'll respond that it was a medicat=
ion mix-up, but I accept responsibility for the two charges.

He does not think we should go to court.=20

It's pretty much what I expected. Or at least not much better, or much worse=
, than what I imagined.=20

I know this is my case and my life and my girls but I also feel like I let y=
ou down, and I want to say I'm sorry.=20
