Thanks,

The summer plans are pretty reasonable, I think two weeks of French camp is
great for their social development and language skills. Most kids are doing
a minimum of 4 camps this summer. Again, the rest of the summer is pretty
flexible and I think I have been accommodating for you to spend time with
the girls. At minimum they have been sleeping over at your place two nights
a week with some smaller visits speckled in there, I think that's good
progress and girls are feeling secure and happy.

I set boundaries with your family, which includes you. I am not interested
in drama, financial burdens, and basically the negativity from all sides.
That being said, if a family member has concerns over someone's health and
the safety of the girls, then yes I will listen.

As for cleanliness and order, I can see your point of being relaxed and
focused on the girls but I do think tidying up when they are in bed or
resting is healthy for them and you. I think it's a bit of a problem when
you can't locate key items of the girls stuff like their blankets and
backpacks.As for getting the girls involved and tidying the big stuff, I
didn't see any of that last Sunday, everything was all over the place and
it didn't seem like there had been any effort over the previous two days to
put away stuff. Also now that you have more time with them, I think it's
reasonable to start tidying a bit more. I can't tell you what to do of
course but seeing your place such a disaster brings up memories from when
you were drinking and your place was in constant chaos.  As you can
understand,  this is a trigger for me and I felt it had to be communicated
with you.

Thanks for the update on your CBT and I am glad it's going well. And yes,
please keep me posted.
