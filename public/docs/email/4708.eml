Hi Cynthia,

Saturdays don=E2=80=99t work for my mom. I know that Kenzie=E2=80=99s =
birthday is important to Alice so one option would be that Alice goes to =
Kenzie=E2=80=99s birthday party and Char comes as usual, with a make-up =
visit on Monday with Alice after school.=20

Alternatively I am available Saturday for an unsupervised visit. Given =
how well parenting time has been going and how comfortable Alice and =
Charlotte are, and that my health and medical records were accepted by =
the judge I think this would be a reasonable and appropriate step to =
take.=20
