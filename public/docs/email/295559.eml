Hi Cynthia,

I understand that the uncertainty and unpredictability that both of them =
are experiencing must be difficult. I spoke to Amanda on the 23rd and =
she is available for sessions, even brief ones, and Charlotte certainly =
needs the support. I am also concerned for Alice.

Since you are refusing to coordinate any outdoor supervised visits, I =
would like to arrange a time to FaceTime with them this weekend. It is =
important that they have contact and communication with me.=20

Please let me know a time that works for them on the 1st or 2nd.=20

Thank you,

Darryl
