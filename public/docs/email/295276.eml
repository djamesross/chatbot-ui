Hi Cynthia,

Indeed she did. She misses me and wants to spend time with me. Children
need both parents.


By the way, your email and demeanour is ambiguous. Personally, I suggest
proofreading, but there is also Grammarly and other extensions, unless
you've changed your mind. Which I doubt given that on the 4th you wrote "Hi
Darryl, Please stop emailing me, texting me and calling me about visitation
and go directly to Alison. I am sorry you have not had a response and I am
aware she will be contacting you shortly. As I continue to state, I do not
want you on my property. If you have more gifts for the children I can
arrange to pick them up or you can mail them." If you do not want me on
your property do not invite me on your property, as you did that day.. I
will ask the same: please do not contact me. Details are below. I
appreciate how sorry you are you lawyer rarely responds to me, if ever.

I will continue to call the girls. Preferably at a set time and for a set
length that is longer given the effort you've put into ensuring I do not
have contact with them. Until the current order is changed, I think it's
reasonable to chat, play games, and watch a show. Routine are acknowledged
to be important, and particularly in this case. I would like to set 2-3
time a week, that don=E2=80=99t change, where I can have uninterrupted and
unsupervised time to talk to the girls. I don=E2=80=99=E2=80=99t think that=
 is to much to
ask, and that the court will agree.

Back to the Easter baskets. I told Alice that her I have easter baskets for
her and Charlotte. She said she wanted to ask you about the presents, left
the phone for a few minutes, then came back and said it was fine. She was
excited. I brought the baskets, I was careful not to step on your property,
respecting your request. The camera mounted in the corner of the garage can
provide evidences. I promised Alice I would bring them, and breaking that
promise can have a negative effects on a child. You were the only person I
saw, and were clearly and emphatically gesturing for two or one more people
not to come downstairs or wherever they were. I don=E2=80=99t know why you =
would do
that, but it appears as though you are did not want them to receive the
baakets from me, further instilling fear in the girls, and further
interfering with my relationship with them. Intentional or not, this is
further reason for the girls to see a psychologist..

I don't read minds, and I don=E2=80=99t know why you refused to allow them =
a brief
visit and to give them their baskets after texting me that you would be
dropping off presents at my house, It should be noted you did not ring the
doorbell or knock and both Ken and I were home and would have heard. Be it
known that a knock or a rug of the doorbell is socially acceptable and
still normal practice when intending to ascertain whether someone is home..
In your text you said, "The girls want to leave you something. Are you
available? If not then we'll leave it outside." I find it odd that you
would use your phone to text, yet refrain from using the doorbells or
knocking. As an aide, did you know that you can text someone using an
iPhone and ensure the other persons=E2=80=99s iPhone does not ring? I thoug=
ht about
that given my phone was beside me with the ringer on. Curiously my phone
was beside me my the times claim you texted. I am not accusing you of doing
that, but pointing out it is possible.


Again, I am returning your email, which you initiated, but will ensure to
direct all future correspondence save that having to do with the girls to
Alison.

Regards,

Darryl
