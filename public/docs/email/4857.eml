Hi Cynthia,

Now that school is done and the girls are back in Ottawa please provide =
me their schedule for summer camps, activities, any further trips, etc., =
as well as what extracurricular activities they are in, including where =
each of them are playing soccer.

I would also like to arrange another day and time to FaceTime with =
Charlotte and Alice, together or individually. Ideally it would be a day =
and time that they choose - I am flexible. I would also be comfortable =
with a flexible day and time of their choice where they are free to =
contact me without prior planning and permission. I would like to plan =
activities to do during FaceTime with each of them, like a game, or even =
watching a show they like.

Best,

Darryl
