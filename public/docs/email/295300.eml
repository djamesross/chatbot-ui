Cynthia,

I've sent medical documents, I've met all of your demands, and I've tried
as hard as I can to keep the girls from conflict. This is documented. I
acted in good faith and assumed you did too. We reached shared custody last
summer.

I spoke with a lawyer today, and have been advised:
- the justification Ms. Boyce gave is entirely separate from access, the
onus is on you to prove otherwise. The other 3-4 reasons you gave: what's
up with those? Again, onus.,
- given the current pandemic this is an urgent matter, and if you continue
to refuse to cooperate or continue to refuse access I will file a motion
next week. I will follow up with the remaining isueses once the courts are
no longer focusing solely on urgent matters.
- If this continues I'vew been advised, with some credulity, to request the
agreement signed in Ms. Boyuce's office be set aside, the one in which the
lanaguage was changed from what we signed, and seeking a substantial
change, for several reasons
- pursuant to such time that the courts resturn to some sort of normalcy I
will be bringing a court motion seeking an urent motion to enforce the
current access described in the court order. The pandemic does not
supersede court orders. It is your choice to change your mind once again
about the need for a supervisor, but given the facts I will be seeking a
qualified supervisor capable of a proper assessment, rather than one of
your parents reading a book.
- currrently you are denying any and all access, for which there is no
basis in fact or evidence, merely heresay. The onus is on you to prove
their safety is at risk, and CAS is not investigating your claims. However,
when you made the initial decision in August you raised no safety concerns.
This is and is only about the girls best interests, which are not being met.
- denial of access, lack of explanation, refusal to all forms of mediation,
discussion, counselling, parent cooridination have been met with silence.
It is clear that court is the last option left.
- Furthmore you have spread rumours making my living situation difficult
and have caused hardship.
- You have refused to follow our agreement without cause to the detriment
of our daughters, and I am documenting all steps taken to prevent them
deveoping a relatinship with me. They deserve and have the riught to have a
healthy relationship with me, without interference.,
- Furthermore after expecting my mother to take on further responsibility
for your convience you have shown no concern for the bond they have
developed.

So, for now I will be seeking enforcement of the existing court order, and
then filing a case based on accusations the onus of which is on you to
prove. In contrast, the onus is on me to show that clear attempts to
withhold the girls from me continue, and that no concern for how our
daughters are actually feeling. The onus is on me to show your lack of
cocnern for their emotional and psychological well-being, for which there
is a long history of texts, emails, and documents that constitute evidence,
not heresay or accusation.

The past months and your lawyer's email suggest I will not recieve a
response, but we have and can act civily and start with an immediate return
to an arranged regular visit, given you attempted to use CAS again and it
did not work. You have withheld two birhdays, and too much time. I will
seek make-up time and continue from there to return to the arrangement we
had reached in the summer and agreed to the summer prior.

I think it's reasonable to agree to restart vists Sunday, though for a
longer period so that I can plan and prepare a small birthday celebration
for both of them.

I will purse all means through the courts until this is settled.

In the meantime I expect you will not involve the girls in the conflict you
have created and seriously consider what is best for the girls. They
deserve two parents, and do not deserve to be controlled, and have their
relationship with me changed on your whim, for reasons that do not matter
to the court.

Further to the current situtation the girls should be allowed to talk or
Facetime with me for as long or as short as they like, and there is no need
for you to end the only contact you have allowed again on your whim,. This
is not about you or I, and I wish it did not have to take court to make
that clear.

I hope you respond with their interests in mind, but to date you have
provided no recourse but court. Should you continue to refuse any and all
concern for the girls you will recive notice next week as per the current
situation.

Darryl
