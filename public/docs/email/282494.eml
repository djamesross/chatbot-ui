Hi there,



I just wanted to update you on a few things.



Ben is now with my full time. He was unhappy at his dad=E2=80=99s house and=
 it was
causing stress so for the time being Scott and I have agreed on this
arrangement. I=E2=80=99m seeing a family therapist with Ben and Scott is pl=
anning
on joining. Also, we are being referred to Youth Services Bureau for some
more help with Ben. So far, it=E2=80=99s been a good move and Ben is much h=
appier
at my place and he doesn=E2=80=99t have any outburst. In terms of his behav=
ior in
front and with the girls, he is doing well. He is working on calming
himself in his room if he gets heated. He understands that the girls are
young and impressionable. He is sensitive to not scare them.



 Ben has been struggling at school and socially. A few weeks ago we met
with Heather Clark from child services to make sure everything was ok at my
home and Scott;s home. She has interviewed Ben, Sam and I and is talking
with Scott she has no major concerns at this point and sees that I=E2=80=99=
m
getting help with Ben. If you have any more questions, please let me know.
I'm also open to meet with Sharon about this if it would help.



Last week I brought up my concerns to Heather Clark about your recent car
accident and other behaviors that I was worried about. Specifically your
past two car accidents especially the most recent when you were close to
being picking up Alice. Your recent forgetfulness in Saturday mornings to
pick up girls and to drop off Charlotte's dance bag. The smell of alcohol
on your breath a few times when I=E2=80=99ve dropped off the girls on after=
 being
in my care for a few days and your unusual late night conversation with
Grace=E2=80=99s mother (while the girls=E2=80=99 were in your care). Like I=
 said before I=E2=80=99m
worried that you are not taking care of yourself, specifically, I mean
drinking while on a high dose of medication or taking too many prescription=
s
medication. I want you to be well and healthy for yourself and the girls.



Cynthia
