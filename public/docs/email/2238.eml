I have hired a lawyer Delainey and Boyce. Alison Boyce is representing me a=
nd will be in contact with your lawyer.

I think it's important for you to know I've been concerned about your recen=
t behaviour and have reached out to Children's Aid who are conducting an in=
vestigation.

I would like to arrange supervised visits with the girls as quickly as poss=
ible and I'll will be in touch with=FD the individual I'm am comfortable wi=
th. At this point, i'm not comfortable with your sister being the superviso=
r as she admittedly recorded my phone conversation with her on Thursday, No=
vember 5th. My trust has been broken.

Again it's important you know that I believe you are important to the kids =
and I'm going to protect that relationship. I'm interested in the children'=
s well being and would to do this as calmly as possible. I really hope you =
will cooperate Darryl.

Cynthia,

I understand that you have been depressed, stressed, and struggling in our =
relationship recently. However, the girls should never have been taken from=
 our home, or from me. There is no basis for your actions. I have a right t=
o see them, and I would like to pick them up from school  tomorrow and keep=
 them for the night. While they are at school tomorrow we can discuss a tem=
porary schedule for visitation.

You can let me know what you need for the night and for tomorrow and I will=
 pack it for you and leave it inside or outside of the house. I will also p=
ack a bag for the girls, and include anything the boys need. However, it is=
 not acceptable to remove any additional belongings.

My lawyer has made it clear to me that you are not acting legally, and she =
will be in contact tomorrow. If  you don't return the girls we will be init=
iating a movement with the court. If you would like to speak to her sooner =
I can provider her number.

Once you have told me what you need I will pack it and leave it in a conven=
ient spot.

Darryl
