Hi Cynthia,

That's really great, thank you, I appreciate it. about the cameras yeah I
thought that was a little weird at first too, but the dad is mostly just
protective with the kids and I think especially having somebody renting in
their house, plus security, and all that.But he doesn't record and it's
never been an issue as long as I've lived there and there are none in the
basement.

An odd request but if you have any boxes would you mind sending them? I got
the girls this really cool gift. it's just these plastic screws an  but
driver and a saw that can cut cardboard but not skin and you can screw
together cardboard to make forks and stuff so I thought that would be fun
but we made it to collect cardboard over time.

Darryl
