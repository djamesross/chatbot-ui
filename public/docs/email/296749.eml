Hi Darryl
Sorry for my delay. I'm home sick with a bad cold (the joys of travelling!)

Too bad about the house.

If you let the case go then you have to let the assessment go as well. The =
goal of the assessment is to get recommendations the court will be able to =
use to decide the case. Why would you want an assessment if you are not pur=
suing the issues in court?

If I start to be more cooperative with her, and tell her that I=92ve decide=

Finally, I don=92t want to give up the option of a custody and access asses=

Any other advice?
