Hi Darryl,
Yes her ankle is sprained and she is to keep it elevated, massage and off
of it for strenuous activities. We had a different doc than Dr. Fraser. For
treatment, we have been massaging it and keeping her off of it at home and
she is not to do any strenuous activity. She took a week off of dance and
gymnastics. She is back in dance but only takes part if her ankle is ok.
It's been a few weeks though and it;s still bothering her so I plan to take
her in early next week.Gymanstics has ended for this term and she will have
two weeks off from dance so I am hopeful it will fully heal.

As far as updates, I think it would be best for you to just add your name
to their school e-mail distribution as well as their teachers  Mme. Kikanda
and Mme. Josee. Also I can add you to danceroots distributio. We get a huge
amount of e-mails from all so it's the best way for you to stay connected
and less onerous on me this way..

As for any other health matters, the girls had a dental check up at school
and all was well. They go for a full cleaning and check up on Jan. 3rd in
bhaven.


Alice is doing ok in school but is finding it challenging to communicate in
French and she frustrates easily. We have been asked to practice counting
numbers and the alphabet in french a few minutes a day at home (making it
fun of course!) I know she would love for you and C to help her along.

Charlotte is doing well in school. We have her friend bday planned for
Sunday at the Bhaven movie theatre from 3-6 pm. If you wanted to contribute
you could prepare a paper treat bags for them to decorate to take home and
$$ towards the party would always help too!

I will follow up on the school e-mails and dance to have you added.


Cynthia
