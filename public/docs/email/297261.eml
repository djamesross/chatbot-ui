Hi Lynda,

Thanks for getting in touch, and for the advice you gave my mom. I=E2=80=99=
m still at the ROH, but doing extremely well. The doctor I=E2=80=99m =
working with, up until 4-5 days ago thought I would be here for another =
two weeks, but we met two days ago, set up a plan for medication and set =
my discharge date for next Wednesday morning. I=E2=80=99ve been feeling =
great, have been reconnecting with family, made some really strong =
friendships with many of the people here, and have even started jogging =
again (to the chagrin of the nurses, but with the encouragement of my =
doctor - 6 km today!).

Julie called me yesterday and we=E2=80=99ve set two appointments for the =
1st and 8th of June, and I may be able to see her the 25th if she has a =
cancellation. (I=E2=80=99m going to call her Thursday afternoon to =
check.)

I talked to the girls on FaceTime earlier this evening, and will try to =
FaceTime with them everyday. Cynthia=E2=80=99s mom is going to bring =
them for a visit this weekend, which I=E2=80=99m so excited for.=20

As for meeting, I can meet here tomorrow, and update you, talk about my =
plans for the coming months, and anything that we need to talk about. I =
can come to your office on the 24th at 1 pm, but if you=E2=80=99re =
available tomorrow I would like to meet sooner than later. I see my =
doctor (Dr. Howard), in the morning, usually by 10-10:30, so anytime =
after that I will be available.

Thanks again for the support and advice,=20
