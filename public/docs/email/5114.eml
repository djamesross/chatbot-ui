I'm sorry, but I was under the impression that I am to deal exclusively
with your lawyer, who you wrote has an access schedule ready to let me
review. That is explicitly what you said. Would you please confirme for me
whether or not that is still the case, and whether or not I can count on
that remaining the case.

You have demonstrated complete disregard for good faith discussions and
agreements. The agreement we had, which Krystle remembers well, you not
only refused to follow but made more restrictive and actively conflictual,
all without justification.

Please note that for me this is not about what you or I want, and I am not
negotiating for myself and against you, but for the rights of our
daughters. They want, and I believe it is best for then, to have two
parents involved and caring. You've actively interfered with that. We have
a temporary order that you have been abusing, and which needs to be
changed, and made into a final order.

So, shall I proceed with you or your lawyer?

Darryl
