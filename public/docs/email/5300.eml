You told me that you left Char=E2=80=99s report card and some =
Valentine=E2=80=99s treats in the mailbox. When I checked, I was =
surprised to find two treats in the bag: one to Charlotte from you, and =
one to Ali from your parents.=20

First of all, it=E2=80=99s entirely ok if you give them their treats a =
couple of days after the actual event. They are 22 months and 4 - they =
still don=E2=80=99t have a clear sense of dates by this age, so you can =
wait, and give them their treats when you have them. But what=E2=80=99s =
more important is the actual giving, rather than the date itself - =
it=E2=80=99s you giving them the valentines gift that is important. They =
don=E2=80=99t care if it=E2=80=99s on the date or not - they want to =
feel a connection to you.

But the issue I have is that you and your family should not be giving =
preferential treatment to the girls, That is not ok. But what=E2=80=99s =
worse is passing it off to me. If you are willing to accept preferential =
treatment, then it is up to you to explain to Ali why she doesn=E2=80=99t =
get anything from mommy, and it is up to you to explain to Char why she =
doesn=E2=80=99t get anything from your parents. To leave that up to me =
is unfair to everyone.=20

I=E2=80=99ve placed the valentines gifts in a bag, and will send them =
back with the girls. They haven=E2=80=99t seen them, and I have not =
mentioned them. My hope is that both of the girls will received =
something from you, and that both of the girls will receive something =
from your parents, It doesn=E2=80=99t matter how big or small it is, but =
it does matter that they both feel that it is fair. Wether we like it or =
not, that is important to kids.=20=
