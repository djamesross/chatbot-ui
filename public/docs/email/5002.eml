Ok, Friday works. I was hoping for one more night, but in the future we =
can check in with each other. I know leading into this summer was very =
uncertain, and you couldn=E2=80=99t be sure if I could be counted on.

Yes, my goal was just to make sure you know if Angie tries to involve =
you in anything, to stay away. That was it. Because she shouldn=E2=80=99t,=
 that=E2=80=99s a major boundary issue, and none of that wold stop her =
from trying. But your response is perfect and will be clear to her.

As for my health, it=E2=80=99s still really good. And now I=E2=80=99m =
out on my road bike again too. And  I=E2=80=99m not struggling to keep =
the house in order or organized, in fact I=E2=80=99m quite relaxed, and =
was left to take care of the entire house for the entire summer. As for =
the house =E2=80=99normally=E2=80=99, Riva is not the cleanest, but not =
dirty or unsanitary. She cleans up after herself, but I don=E2=80=99t =
think she=E2=80=99s ever cleaned the blinds, as an example. I clean my =
room and bathroom thoroughly, and the girls are healthy here. There=E2=80=99=
s been like 4 or 5 CAS visits, and three different people, so they=E2=80=99=
d all be good to check with. But when we=E2=80=99re here for the day, or =
in and out, I like it to be a kids house. Since my time with them is =
limited I spend it doing things with them, or just spending time with =
them, and don=E2=80=99t worry about a big clean up until they=E2=80=99re =
gone. I=E2=80=99ve got bins organized that I just pull out and put back, =
depending on what we=E2=80=99re doing. Stephanie might be a good person =
to ask if you think it=E2=80=99s a sign of a problem, because she was =
just here,  but I can assure you it isn=E2=80=99t. It=E2=80=99s actually =
more to do with having worked on my values and goals, through =
counselling. When it comes to my time here with the girls, it has to be =
sanitary, but I don=E2=80=99t worry about crafts or toys or things moved =
around. And we do a lot of crafts, games, and playing. I do get the =
girls to help with tidying the big stuff, when we start something new, =
and I always ask them to clean their own mess, because that=E2=80=99s =
just a good thing to learn. The rest, like tidying and deeper cleaning, =
I save for later.=20

I=E2=80=99ve had two sessions already and it=E2=80=99s going well. =
I=E2=80=99ll let you know as it progresses, but the focus is on common =
life challenges, and then a particular focus on dealing with the extreme =
financial situation I=E2=80=99m in. But that=E2=80=99s not considered a =
mental health issue or trigger, because it is real situation that has to =
be dealt with. That=E2=80=99s part of the reason I decided to pay closer =
attention to my finances. I=E2=80=99ve been able to deal with it on my =
own and with people close to me, but help from a professional is great, =
and I=E2=80=99ll learn new skills. So CBT looks like it will help, and =
it=E2=80=99s the most effective form of talk-therapy.=20

Ok, so I=E2=80=99ll check with the girls about tomorrow and let you =
know.
