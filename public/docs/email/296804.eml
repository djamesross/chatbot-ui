Excellent work Darryl with CHEO and CAS. I will prepare a reply this evenin=

As you are working on your response, please expand on the nature of your me=
ntal health issues. We want to explain how you became depress, when, the tr=
eatment received. It has to be compatible with the notes from the doctors.
Will be in touch later.

She met with Cynthia, Ben, and the girls this morning. She said that they a=

The complaint was made against me, citing mental health concerns, alcohol c=

The earliest that she can meet me is Monday, so we made an appointment at 9=
 am. She does not have a copy of the medical records, so I offered to send =
her a copy (please let me know if that was a bad idea for any reason).
