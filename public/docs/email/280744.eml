Please avoid walking by my place and asking random strangers or your mother
to drop off things, that makes me really uncomfortable. We can arrange pick
up.

Same phone number you have been using.

Please return the skates and helmets, helmets I can always use and Alice
may fit into Charlotte's. Or at least sell or get a credit.

No lessons, everything is closed.

Please review my lawyer's last correspondence with you on restrictions.

The girls can Facetime at 5 pm today, Thursday at 5  and Saturday at 10 am.

Cynthia
