&gt; Hi Darryl,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Following up on a few things. Schedule is set for Spring summer girls h=
ave soccer Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday evening.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For school night visits please let me know if Thursday works for you bo=
th. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For Sunday visits I can bring girls for 930 am and pick up for 4 pm ( s=
occer practice for Ali is at 445 in Barrhaven) or we can switch to Saturdays=
 for Spring Summer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Next weekend as I have said in my previous email Charlotte has a tourna=
ment all weekend so you can join either Saturday or Sunday and visit with Al=
ice as visitation. It=E2=80=99s at Ottawa Business Park. As I suggested earl=
ier perhaps your mom could come in the weekend to help with driving and we c=
ould drive girls on weeknight. Please let me know&nbsp; so I can make approp=
riate arrangements.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Also Charlotte will be away in Kingston June 7-9 for a tournament and I=
 am not sure when she will be back again you are welcome to drive up. Alice i=
s staying with my mom and can coordinate a visit.<br>
