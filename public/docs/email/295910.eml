Cyn,

I was shocked and sickened to find out that you are accusing me of =
molesting Charlotte. To be called a pedophile, and an incestuous =
pedophile, by my own wife, is heartbreaking. There has been a lot of =
hard feelings between us these past few months, but there are still =
years in our past of good times, of love, of friendship, and of caring. =
To be accused of such horrible acts truly hurts. To have to even imagine =
them, is truly sickening.

These are horrible allegations. Monstrous, even. And they hurt me. But =
what I=E2=80=99m more worried about is how they will affect Charlotte =
and Alice. What if one of them hears about these rumours - through a =
family member, someone in the community, or some other way? What if, =
when they are teenagers, someone says =E2=80=98hey, isn=E2=80=99t that =
the girl who=E2=80=99s father molested her?=E2=80=99 Rumours like this =
do not need truth to hurt, and would do terrible damage to a teenage =
girl - or a girl of any age. If anyone believes even part of this story, =
it could mean no playdates at my house, it could create tension at =
school, it could hurt our girls, and it could affect my career. The =
damage that false rumours like this can do cannot be calculated neatly.

I am truly sorry that our marriage is ending. There was a lot of good in =
it, and it brought me happiness. But while our marriage is ending, our =
relationship together is not. It=E2=80=99s not ending, but it is =
changing. Our relationship will continue as the parents of Charlotte and =
Alice. And that relationship needs to work, for the sake of Alice and =
Charlotte, and Ben and Sam.

We should be working on our new relationship right now, so that we can =
support our children. We=E2=80=99ve both made mistakes, we=E2=80=99ve =
both got parts of our past that we regret, but neither of us are unfit =
parents, and neither of us deserves to be excluded from our childrens' =
lives. We need to be working together to make this work for our kids. We =
can take the insults, the lonely nights, the hurt feelings, the lawyers =
bills. They should not have to. Like it or not, we will be co-parents. =
They will be spending time with each of us, and we will have to work =
together. The other option is unthinkable for both of us, because it =
would disadvantage them. I know, in my heart, that we can do this so =
that our children can do better than we did. That was always something =
that we shared. A dream that we can still work together on: we can make =
our childrens=E2=80=99 lives a bit better than our own. We can do that, =
because we share something that is not over - our love for them. All of =
them.

Maybe you thought I could have done those things to Charlotte. Maybe you =
really believed it was possible. Maybe. But it=E2=80=99s not. That case =
is closed, because it never happened. And now we need to move on. We =
need to do this for our children.

Darryl
