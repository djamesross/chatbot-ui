Hi Darryl,

I checked into the legalities  around acquiring your passport signature
and providing  copies of the ticket before signing is not a requirement. As
I have said, I won't have the tickets booked for another month before we
depart to save on costs and the exact dates need to be confirmed because we
are staying at a friend's new condo and we don't know the exact day it will
be ready. We should know this at the end of January early February.  Once I
book the actual tickets, I will send you the information requested as it is
legally required and I do believe I will need a letter from you stating you
give permission for the girls to be travelling overseas  with me. I have
shared below the details that I know to date. The March Break is two months
away and processing time can take 20 business days, so we are cutting it
close and I want to avoid being stressed about the documentation and
waiting until the last minute and paying a larger processing fee.


   - Confirmed destination and exact dates of departure/return -*Pacifico
   Resort, Playa Del Coco, Guanascaste, Costa Rica, The window of travel da=
tes
   are between March 7-14th *
   - Copies of the flight tickets and booking confirmation for the girls -*
   I will send when we book. We most likely will fly into Toronto and fly o=
ut
   directly to Liberia, Costa Rica. The resort is 30 min drive from the
   Liberia airport.*
   - The address where you and the girls will be staying:* Condominios
   Pacifico, Playas del Coco, Carillo, Guanacaste, Costa Rica, subcondomini=
o
   5B*
   - Emergency contact information while you=E2=80=99re away: *You can reac=
h me
   directly via text/whatsapp or email. My friend who we are staying with
   Liza Wilson 613- 867-5492. The condo has wifi and some part of the groun=
ds
   so you will have access to contact the girls when we are at the room and=
 by
   the pool.*
   - Details of any other planned or anticipated travel for the girls
   within the next 12 months - * As usual, girls are off from soccer last
   week in July , first week in August and if I can afford it, I will take
   them to Saskatchewan for a family reunion being held on July 25th at Tur=
tle
   Lake that Dennis's family is hosting and then stay with my sister Heathe=
r
   for a week in Saskatoon. They will most likely each do 5 days at the Rid=
eau
   Hill sleepaway camp this year (no dates yet). Other than that I have no
   travel plans. Alot depends on my finances at the time.I will update you
   when I know more.*


The girls are very excited to be travelling to a warm destination for the
first time! I will send along the paperwork for you to sign on the first
page and be in touch with the exact travel dates, flight information,
letter requirements as soon as possible.
