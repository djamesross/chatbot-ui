Hi Cynthia,

I met with Eric the girl's new principal. He informed me that I have been
removed from the right to access information about the girls. We maintain
joint custody so I assume this is a mistake. I will send him the relevant
documents to correct it, but in the meantime wondered if you knew anything
about it?
