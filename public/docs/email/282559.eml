Hi Darryl,

Thanks for your email, going forward I am comfortable with extending the
supervised visit on Sunday from noon to 6 pm. This may have to slightly
change depending on soccer times on Sunday morning for the girls. I should
have a better idea early next month.

I know the girls are enjoying their time with you both, which gives them
and myself a lot of joy. At this time I am only comfortable with supervised
visits.

Thank you.

Cynthia
