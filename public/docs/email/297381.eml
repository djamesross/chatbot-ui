Hello Cynthia, and Heather!

Yes we are aware of this as we ran in to Heather a few weeks ago. If you
recall my husband is a psychologist and we certainly always have the girls
best interest as a priority. We are an active part of Darryl's and their
lives.

Our only concern lately, which we had expressed to Heather, was that you
were withholding them from Darryl. We fully support Darryl picking them up
yesterday, and will continue to support Darryl picking up the girls on his
nights.

We will certainly reach out to Heather, or you, should we have any concerns
for their well being. As well, Heather has my contact and is welcome to
reach out any time.

Many thanks for your concerns,

Angie
