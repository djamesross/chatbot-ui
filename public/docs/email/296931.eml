HI Any,

So i=E2=80=99m meeting with our CAS case worker Monday afternoon. My =
instinct is to tell her exactly what happened. Is that the best =
approach? I can tel her everything,, or a very basic version. I=E2=80=99ve=
 been trying to get in touch with the lawyer you recommened  - hopefully =
I can do that before I see her, but any advice  wold be helpful=20

In the meantime, when do you need my financial statement?=20
