Hi Darryl,

Thanks for the e-mail. I sent you three receipts for Charlotte's dance and
gymnastics so far, totaling $1,175. It;s pretty steep sp I would appreciate
some financial help on those one.

I have taken out Alice out of skating, she is really tired and still
adjusting to school so I made the decision to hold off for a week. Plus she
refuses to go. That saves me $275:)

As for helping out with activities like pick up, as for now, the two
activities require driving so we are covered. But to be honest, I am not
entirely comfortable relying on you for pick up and drop off at this time.
I am hopeful in the future this will change as I know you are working on
this and the girls really need you in their life. The healthier you are the
better it is for them:)

Also, I still have not received any paper work from Family Court on having
the support payment automatized, have you completed everything on your end?

Do you anticipate you will be well for Sunday's visit?

Cynthia
