Hi Sharon,

Thank-you for the quick response, and that=E2=80=99s a relief. I assumed =
it would be much more (without, of course, knowing what such a thing =
would cost...).

Would you be able to email me a bill, and if so can I e-transfer my half =
of the cost?

I can also share the bill with Cynthia, if she hasn=E2=80=99t been in =
touch with you. I don=E2=80=99t think it will be a problem, but if she =
refuses to cover half of the cost I will pay for it (I have enough =
coverage for Char through work, and it starts again in less than a =
month.)

Thanks,

Darryl
