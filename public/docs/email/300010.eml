Hi Cynthia,

A suggestion from my mom regarding a first step. She would prefer to be =
home earlier on Sundays if possible. She is coming in tomorrow either =
way, but if she picks up the girls can you or your mom pick up the girls =
in the evening so she can leave in the afternoon before it is dark? This =
would be a reasonable first step, and allow her to be home for Sunday =
evening.

Darryl

The forecast is calling for as much as 100 cm of snow between about 3 pm =
