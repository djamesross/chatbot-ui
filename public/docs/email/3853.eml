Hi Cynthia,

I=E2=80=99m writing to let you know I will be starting a treatment =
program next Tuesday. It is for 3 months and is highly regarded. You can =
look it up at serenityhouseottawa.com <http://serenityhouseottawa.com/>. =
I=E2=80=99m attaching a document with basic information. Some =
information hasn=E2=80=99t been updated, like cell phone time, but I =
will be able to use my cell phone and FaceTime the stay in touch with =
the girls at certain times, after the first three days. I agree routine =
is best for the girls, so please let me know the best time to schedule =
regular calls. They can be on any of the following: Mon., Tues., Thurs., =
after 3:30 pm, Fridays after 9:30, and weekends.

I explained to girls where I=E2=80=99m going and why I=E2=80=99m going, =
and reassured them I will be safe, getting the best treatment, and =
reachable, so they don=E2=80=99t have to worry. They=E2=80=99ve told me =
that you enrolled them in a counselling program which sounds very =
positive. Please let me know more information about it, so I can support =
them too.

The Sunday is Father=E2=80=99s Day, and two days later I will be =
entering the program, and the counsellor I=E2=80=99m currently working =
with said that it is important to spend time with them before I leave, =
to reassure them, and reduce any feelings of insecurity or shame. I=E2=80=99=
d like to meet them at a park nearby for two hours so we can play and =
have lunch or snacks. Do they have a current favourite park? And would =
morning or afternoon work better for you?

Sincerely,
Darryl
