Hi Lynda,

Can you give feedback this when you have a chance. I feel like it=E2=80=99s t=
oo mid, as we talked about. But I really so want to connect I a civil war.=20=


Cynthia,

I=E2=80=99m on new drug trintallex. Here=E2=80=99s one possible side effect (=
 and since I=E2=80=99d had no alcohol, may be likely):
=E2=80=9CDrowsiness/reduced alertness: Although vortioxetine is not known to=
 cause drowsiness, avoid driving, operating machinery, or performing other h=
azardous tasks until you have determined how this medication affects you=E2=80=
=9D

(The text will make sense after ready further. And yes, I should have  proba=
bly cancelled looking back. But it wasn=E2=80=99t alcohol, and when I left I=
 felt fine)

To  Cynthia:

I am, and when you=E2=80=99re ready I=E2=80=99d like explain how, and why, I=
 don=E2=80=99t hold anger toward you,  While I will disagree on this or that=
 topic, I want 50-50, co-co-parenting, and a civil relationship, and I think=
 we can work our those things. The girls need to  one first. But I know you n=
eed to ready, and I=E2=80=99ll wait.=20

I=E2=80=99m sorry for the misunderstanding today, i mis them like crazy. But=
 I can see your concerns, and empathize. I would do the same. I=E2=80=99m go=
ing to look into the medications so we can be sure there isn=E2=80=99t negat=
ive interaction. I have stopped two.=20

So when you=E2=80=99re ready,I am. I know Alison costs a lot, and I=E2=80=99=
m representing my self. Never my strike pay last we was $137  I have to keep=
 hydro and Enbridge, but I will make it up to you (though Aliaon will have t=
o advise you on that).

(The picture above will make sense after ready the text.)

I am, and when you=E2=80=99re ready I=E2=80=99d like explain how, and why, I=
 don=E2=80=99t hold anger toward you, i detail my responsibility as I see it=
, and listen to what you think it is. I will disagree on this or that topic,=
 but there are things I missed, or don=E2=80=99t see at alL

I want 50-50, co-co-parenting, and a civil relationship. I thin that is the b=
est possible for the girls. =20

And I think we can work our those things, with help. The girls need to  one f=
irst. But I know you need to be ready, and feel safe, and I=E2=80=99ll wait u=
ntil that time and place.=20

I=E2=80=99m sorry for the misunderstanding today, and miss them like crazy. I=
=E2=80=99m going to look into the medications so we can can be sure, but I h=
ave stopped two.=20

So when you=E2=80=99re ready I am. I know Alison cost a lot, and I=E2=80=99m=
 representing my self. Never my strike pay last we was $137  I have to keep h=
ydro and Enbridge, but I will make it up to you (though Aliaon will have to a=
dvise you on that). N
