Sam was upset last night. Really upset. We talked about the problem, and he=
 felt better. But I was worried that there was something bigger going on =
=96 something that had happened to him. I pointed out that he=92s had lots =
of hard feelings lately, and asked him if there are any really big problems=
 he=92s had, something that a person has done to him. Your concerns about T=
racy=92s dad had come to mind, and I was worried something had happened tha=
t might explain why he=92s so upset about so many things. He said yes, and =
it's Charlotte. Charlotte is a person who is causing him a lot of problems =
in his life.

Where does this come from? He barely interacts with her anymore. He=92s alm=
ost always on media. He barely plays with her or talks to her anymore. How =
can she be such a problem to him? Where is this coming from? His problem wi=
th her is that she asks him what=92s wrong, or why he=92s upset =96 which a=
re healthy, normal things to do. We want her to ask those questions, and th=
ink they are normal, healthy questions. We don=92t want her to feel bad for=
 trying to talk to someone about their feelings =96 especially not a family=
 member.

I=92m concerned about the role that his dad plays in this. His dad is manip=
ulating his relationship with Ben =96 is he doing it with Charlotte too? He=
=92s told the boys that she=92s my favourite =96 has he said anything else?

I=92m really struggling with this. I have been concerned about Sam for a lo=
ng time, and want to help him. This adds another layer. He=92s not just suf=
fering in silence =96 he hurt her feelings yesterday, and she acted out bec=
ause of it. It was hard to see her affected in the morning by Ben=92s anger=
, and then to be rejected by Sam in the afternoon. I really need to get a s=
ense of where the girls stand in this, and how it might affect them. I want=
 to ask Dr. James what we can do for the girls when the boys get angry,  an=
d how to talk to the boys or deal with them to build their relationships wi=
th the girls.

I also want to focus on what we can do about Scott, and how we can limit hi=
s influence on our family.

I don=92t know if it=92s the medication, but I ask that you take Sam off it=
 for a while, to see if his mood improves. It was obviously a problem at hi=
gher doses. We need to know if it=92s still a problem. School is very impor=
tant, but emotional health is far more important to his happiness and life,=
 and to the other kids.
