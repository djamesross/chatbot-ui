Hi Alison,

I hope you are well and staying healthy, both you and yours.

I=E2=80=99m writing to address a very serious issue that I would hope we ca=
n
address through mediation or arbitration. However, that would mean
communication, which appears not to be something your client is willing to
do. I sincerely hope I am wrong. I=E2=80=99m sorry I haven=E2=80=99t heard =
back from you,
and that your client is unwilling to communicate with me and is going to
great lengths to ensure I cannot have contact with our daughters, Charlotte
and Alice. Your client refuses to share any information with me about their
activities, well-being, their psychological state when put in the context
of how many times she has made unilateral and extreme decisions with no
regard for their feelings, rights, or what they might be thinking
(displaying a complete lack of what a psychologist would call a theory of
mind). Your client has told me directly she wants no contact with me, which
I have no fundamental quarrel with, except that we have two daughters, and
she has made that decision for our daughters to severely restrict their
relationship with their father. The facts are clear, and this situation is
only getting worse.

Further, your client has announced on several occasions that it is within
her rights to disregard court orders and, I am paraphrasing, but I could
just as well quote, she believes Child Services has given her the authority
to do so. Child Services closed the case and stated that supervision was
not necessary, and did not give your client special or official powers to
justify acts that restrict my rights, which are only secondary to the
rights of our daughters.

I have had a substantial change in circumstances that I expect will have to
be discussed and addressed. I am researching the situation and waiting for
more information, and will be in contact early next week whether or not I
hear from you. I have to assume your client is aware I have not been able
to make payments to FRO, and whether or not she has informed you, it is
very odd but also fitting, given her actions, that there has been no
communication. And to be clear, I am describing her actions and statements.
I have no way of knowing what her motivation or reasoning is.

Failure to make payments to FRO is vexing to me but in no way intentional.
Instead, I am trying to rectify the situation and make up for missed
payments. I intend to follow the court order to the extent possible.

Before I do, however, I will be addressing in a separate letter your
client=E2=80=99s onerous restrictions that may prevent me from being able t=
o see
Alice on or around her birthday and to see Charlotte as well. I am
reviewing recent cases that are similar and waiting for legal counsel and
will explain more clearly the current facts of the situation. For now, I
can say that your client=E2=80=99s decision to strictly control Alice=E2=80=
=99s ability to
maintain and develop an individual relationship with me is unjustified and
once again I insist that she see a psychologist as recommended by Dr,
Brenhouse. Her actions, regardless of intent, fit those described in other
cases where the custodial parent creates a situation in which the children
are estranged, driven apart from, and isolated from the other parent.

Again, I will be in touch early next week when I have information for you,
as well as to address these extremely concerning actions.

Sincerely,

Darryl
