Alright, so let=E2=80=99s do a financial breakdown before we jump all =
over this.

If we close May 31, our balance owing will be 517,615.38.=20

But, we will have a  penalty of approximately 3,620, with a discharge =
fee of 411.30. Our outstanding property taxes will be 3,432.85 (2015) & =
1,525.71 (2016). Legal fees will be about 1200. That adds up to =
10,189.86.

If we counter at 545,000, let=E2=80=99s say, realistically, that we can =
get them to 540,000. At 540,000, Jenna=E2=80=99s fee will be 27,000.=20

That=E2=80=99s a total of 37,189.86.

Add that to the amount owing on our mortgage, and we=E2=80=99re looking =
at a net loss of 14,805.24.

That=E2=80=99s 7,402.62 each, that we owe, in debt, if we sell at =
540,000.

The last house they bid on was listed at 585,000, and they lost it =
because it went for over asking price. They might want this house cheap, =
but that doesn=E2=80=99t mean the house is worth what they=E2=80=99re =
willing to pay.

Waiting a little longer might feel stressful, but it will be far easier =
than paying thousands of dollars extra in debt, with interest, for the =
next decade or so.

That=E2=80=99s my position.
