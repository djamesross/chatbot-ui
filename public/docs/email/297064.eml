Hi Any,

I forgot to ask you about costs when we were talking yesterday. Is there =
a way that I can sue for costs related to the case? (Damages?). You=E2=80=99=
ve explained why family court is not interested in blame - their focus =
is the kids, and that=E2=80=99s for the best. But is there another way =
of coming at the costs that have accumulated since she left? If the =
focus of the case was her behaviour and affidavits, then maybe the case =
would be much stronger. (For example, in her latest affidavit she states =
that she notified the police about her =E2=80=9Cserious ongoing =
concerns.=E2=80=9D We now know that she did not notify the police.)

At this point, there=E2=80=99s nothing I can do to make the relationship =
worse. She=E2=80=99s already done that. Already I have a friend who =
won=E2=80=99t see me because he=E2=80=99s married to a friend of =
Cynthia=E2=80=99s, and a neighbour that won=E2=80=99t look at me =
anymore, because of what Cynthia said to her. Truth be told, the money =
matters to me. But more than the money, it=E2=80=99s about being able to =
say that I fought her accusations and won. That, to me, would be =
invaluable, for my own peace of mind. It=E2=80=99s not about hurting =
her, but vindicating myself. For example - and I don=E2=80=99t even know =
if this could happen or not - if we sued her for costs and she said that =
she=E2=80=99d admit to making up everything in exchange for me agreeing =
to never seek damages from her, I would do it. Gladly!

What do you think?
