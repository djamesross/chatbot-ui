Approximately what time did she hit head at soccer this morning? 11 am
Who was responsible for picking her up? My mother who came at noon however,
a family friend, Matt Streter,  called me as he was there earlier. Matt and
his wife Michelle know the girls well, his daughters are BFFs with
girls (Gabby and Kenzie)
What time did they notify you? Matt notified me. I sent an email to the OSU
director and indicated that the staff should have called me. THe Staff did
follow procedure although they know for future to contact parent
What time did you bring her to CHEO? We got there at 130

This is the first time you have told me about soccer camp: what soccer camp
is it, and where?
 You were aware of soccer camp from girls and also you were trying to make
arrangements to pick them up after at my place. It's OSU soccer camp,
mornings in Manotick. They play for this organization.

Charlotte is feeling much better today and I am following the doctor's
advice. Just to be safe,  she is on a rest day, no camp, no swimming, just
her physio appointment.

THey plan to FT you tomorrow at 10 am.

I will update you if she feels unwell. Right now, we are taking it day to
day but it;s looking like it's a minor head injury as opposed to a
concusison, which is good news.. As ordered, I am following the medical
pamphlet they provided.
