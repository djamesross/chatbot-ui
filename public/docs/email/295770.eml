Getting over that feeling is huge. He should rightly bear that burden. It d=
oes feel good to stand up for yourself. I still feel good about my conversa=
tions with my mom, even if the aftermath is hard.

Thanks babe, it felt good and it was easy to write (even if I cried through=
 some of it) .  I don't think I would have been able to say these things fa=
ce to face but I needed to get them out and not be worried about his reacti=
on and feelings.

Today at 10:22 AM
At first I was happy to see that you reached out. However, after I read you=
r e-mail and had some time to reflect, I was disappointed in your response.

I feel that you dismissed my feelings about your drinking and did not indic=
ate that you even have a problem. It is black and white: Have you quit drin=
king? Can you at least admit to having a drinking problem?

I don=92t believe e-mail --or anything else -- could destroy our 37- year- =
father- daughter relationship. I don=92t like that you alluded to this as a=
 possibility.

These other issues are heavy ones that take a lot of courage for me to brin=
g up.

Firstly, when I was just a young girl, you sexualized my environment by dis=
playing nude photos of women in your home, fondling your girlfriends while =
I was in the room, checking out other woman in front of me and having loud =
sex when I was in the other room trying to sleep. This was extremely diffic=
ult for me to make sense of. I felt confused, scared, shocked and ashamed. =
You are my dad and you are supposed to protect me from these things, instea=
d you exposed me to them at a tender young age. I=92m mad about this.

Secondly, you are an exhibitionist. Since I was young, you walked around in=
 a robe with nothing else on, paying no attention to the people around and =
how this would make me feel. I have so many memories of this and how embarr=
assed and ashamed I was of myself for not saying anything or just being the=
re. It=92s been an awful, awful feeling and it=92s affected my relationship=
 with men. My last vivid memory of this was you standing in your room, talk=
ing on the phone with your robe open and clearly seeing me in the other roo=
m below. This is not okay.

So yes I would like to meet and I expect a sincere apology, I want you for =
one minute to put yourself in that little girl=92s shoes and understand som=
e of her feelings. I deserve this and I want you to put me first.


Cynthia
