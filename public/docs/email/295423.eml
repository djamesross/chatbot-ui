I will definitely try to, and am glad you asked. I think they should be able=
 do all of the activities they are interested in, and want to share costs. I=
wish it were otherwise, but I do have to prioritize, and I think the most im=
portant thing is to move closer so I can be part of their social & school li=
fe, and help with local activities. But that=E2=80=99s just short term - I w=
ant to share everything as soon as I can, and at least help as much as I can=
 for now.=20

Can you let me know all of the activities and costs, and give me a few days o=
r a week? It=E2=80=99s a tough week: I=E2=80=99ve got midterms, marking, and=
 lectures. But I do want to figure out how I can help.

I know it=E2=80=99s not a lot, but one of the ways I can help is if the acti=
vities are close to your place - like at the pool, or a local skating rink. I=
f there is skating nearby, or swimming, or other activities, I can help by p=
icking them, taking them, and then bringing them back to your place. The lat=
est class I have this semester is 2 pm, so I can help any day after school. A=
nd next semester I will be available at least 3 afternoons each week. I know=
 dance is a drive, but I=E2=80=99d like to help with any activities that I c=
an.

Let me know how I can help, both financially and by taking them to local act=
ivities or any other ways I can help, and I=E2=80=99ll get back to you by th=
e end of the week.

Darryl
