Hi Darryl,

The girls have never missed a FT and if they are busy they have always
rescheduled. Their calendar is very busy now with soccer, babysitting and
tutoring but they do make time to FT you twice a week normally for almost
an hour. on Thursdays and Saturdays.

The tutor was last minute as they only have limited availability. It's a
free service offered by the board and will definitely help the girls with
their French levels. We were on a waitlist for months.

The girls can FT Thursday 4-5 pm until the end of June and when tutoring
ends, pick up at 5 pm if that works.

Cynthia
