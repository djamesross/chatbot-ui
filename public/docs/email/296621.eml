 your behaviour reveals a very different pattern. The girls are fully aware t=
hat I am healthy and taking care of myself, yet they do not know why you ref=
use to let them see me. And that is an unfortunate position to be in, I unde=
rstand. You would have to say that you have not seen me and do not know my m=
ental or physical health, have made no attempt to ask me, have ignored the C=
hildren=E2=80=99s Aid Society=E2=80=99s concldusions, which I fear will conf=

ptable. I can=E2=80=99t comfortably parent my children in the house that you=

  people who are participating in preventing me from access to my daughters,=
