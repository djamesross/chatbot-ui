I=E2=80=99m glad you=E2=80=99re thinking about these things, and finding =
things to be excited about, but I feel that I should be included in some =
of the decisions you=E2=80=99re making, instead of just informed about =
them. Some are personal, but some are about the family. I hope that you =
still think of it as our family, even though things are tough.

I think it would be good if we could try to see our counsellor sooner, =
to talk through some of the bigger issues that have come up. Would you =
be ok with that?
