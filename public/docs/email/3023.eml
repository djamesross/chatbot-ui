Hi Cynthia,

This issue has been made as clear as it can be: Caring for sick children is p=
art of parenting time, and she will be well taken care of today when she is w=
ith me.=20

Today is an important day. As I planned with both of them we are putting up a=
 tree and decorating. Ali can lay comfortably while we do, or nap in my room=
 if she wants.=20

Either way I expect Ali to be dropped of by 12:30.=20

Please confirm by 11 am.=20

Darryl
