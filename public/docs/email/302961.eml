Hi Jane,

Thank you for your help and suggestions so far. To date nothing has =
changed, and I have only had one additional supervised visit with my =
daughters. =46rom what I can tell they haven=E2=80=99t been told =
anything, and their mother appears to be=E2=80=A6 just putting me off. I =
think the only option is to prepare a motion requesting a new order, and =
I am ready to start preparing it but I want legal advice to make sure I =
prepare it well.

I have written Cynthia at least twice clearly explaining that this =
situation breaks a standing court order, and asked for information and =
an explanation for why she is refusing all access, save two short and =
supervised visits. All that she has said to this point is that she=E2=80=99=
s not comfortable with any further requests, and that her lawyer will be =
in touch soon. Her lawyer has not been in touch. I have been trying to =
get as much information as I can, and prepare a motion, but I am =
struggling with how best to go about this. I have two general sorts of =
questions that I need advice with. The first are quite specific, like =
how should I communicate with her right now, plan time to see my =
daughters, even if supervised, etc. The second are about preparing the =
motion, like what should I be doing to ensure my case is as strong as it =
can be, what should I include in the motion, what should I include in my =
affidavit, and so on.

 I have waited, both for court records and in the hopes that she would =
change her position, but I think waiting any longer will be pointless, =
and may in fact be the goal. I have to get this started as soon as =
possible. Do you time, perhaps two or three hours this week and next, =
that I could book? Or if you don=E2=80=99t have the time would you =
recommend a few people that I could contact?

Thank you,

Darryl
