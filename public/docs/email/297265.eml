Hi Lynda,

I=E2=80=99ve been considering your offer, and can=E2=80=99t decide if it =
would help or hurt. For instance, Todd and my sister have the best =
intentions, and have done much to help, but they have also hurt more =
than helped. My sister will watch the girls, but excludes me. And Todd =
was never really invested in supervising. They decided what I needed to =
do: they=E2=80=99re working under an outdated model of addiction. They =
did not trust the doctors I have seen, to the point of questioning their =
credentials and experience. Based on their understanding of what I=E2=80=99=
m going through, I believe that they have decided what I have/must do to =
atone (and I think that word is apropos: it=E2=80=99s got moral, =
behavioural, and value intentions). They have a view that is so far from =
OAARS, or anyone I=E2=80=99ve worked with. =20

 I strongly doubt my sister will attend. I also think that Todd=E2=80=99s =
wife Cindy is an important part of this, but again I doubt that she=E2=80=99=
d attend. Ditto Kevin, Angie=E2=80=99s husband. My sense is that a =
consensus has been reached, and will stand.=20

I see the ideal outcome from such a meeting, but I fear it will lead to =
more disappointment and judgment, which has hurt. Deeply. And as a whole =
literature on psychology suggests, the more we disagree, the more we end =
up with entrenched opinions.

They have tried to help, with the best of intentions, and expressed =
distress. They don=E2=80=99t know what to do, or how to help, and I =
understand that. But rather than talk, I=E2=80=99ve experienced more =
hurt than help. I keep returning to the professionals, because they =
should guide my recovery, not my family. I want love and support and =
help from them, I=E2=80=99ve asked for it,  but on my journey, guided by =
professionals with experience. I understand their trust has been broken, =
but I sense no understanding of what I=E2=80=99ve experienced, the =
trauma, or the need to heal. Instead, I was given marching orders, and =
one best not fall from that march, lest the consequences.=20

But, I believe you know best. And I trust Lisa. If you both agree, I =
defer to your judgement. The only concern I have is attendance: if =
it=E2=80=99s only Todd, or Todd and Angie, then I don=E2=80=99t think it =
will help. Todd is trying, but his ability to deal with this is limited =
(as would mine be). He is there, and then not, and then there, and =
then=E2=80=A6 Angie and Todd both have partners, and they have very =
strong opinions. And again, they talk about me, but not too me. =20

All that said, it would be good for them to know what I am doing, who I =
am seeing, and to hear it from you, given that they trust you. Perhaps =
Cynthia more than anyone.=20

So, if you think it best, then I do to.

By the way, I went to OAARS and they are going to try to fast track me =
to see and addiction and trauma counsellor. I=E2=80=99ve been doing a =
lot of reading and research and alcohol seems to be a solution to =
trauma. I am working on that trauma and seeing progress. And from what I =
understand addiction counsellors are trained in dealing with trauma too.

I will let you know when I get an appointment, and keep you up tp date.

Darryl

class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">I=E2=80=99ve been considering your =
offer, and can=E2=80=99t decide if it would help or hurt. For instance, =
Todd and my sister have the best intentions, and have done much to help, =
but they have also hurt more than helped. My sister will watch the =
girls, but excludes me. And Todd was never really invested in =
supervising. They decided what I needed to do: they=E2=80=99re working =
under an outdated model of addiction. They did not trust the doctors I =
have seen, to the point of questioning their credentials and experience. =
Based on their understanding of what I=E2=80=99m going through, I =
believe that they have decided what I have/must do to atone (and I think =
that word is apropos: it=E2=80=99s got moral, behavioural, and value =
intentions). They have a view that is so far from OAARS, or anyone =
I=E2=80=99ve worked with. &nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">&nbsp;I strongly doubt my sister will =
attend. I also think that Todd=E2=80=99s wife Cindy is an important part =
of this, but again I doubt that she=E2=80=99d attend. Ditto Kevin, =
Angie=E2=80=99s husband. My sense is that a consensus has been reached, =
and will stand.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">I see the ideal outcome from such a meeting, but I fear it =
will lead to more disappointment and judgment, which has hurt. Deeply. =
And as a whole literature on psychology suggests, the more we disagree, =
the more we end up with entrenched opinions.</div><div class=3D""><br =
class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">They have tried to help, with the best =
of intentions, and expressed distress. They don=E2=80=99t know what to =
do, or how to help, and I understand that. But rather than talk, I=E2=80=99=
ve experienced more hurt than help. I keep returning to the =
professionals, because they should guide my recovery, not my family. I =
want love and support and help from them, I=E2=80=99ve asked for it, =
&nbsp;but on my journey, guided by professionals with experience. I =
understand their trust has been broken, but I sense no understanding of =
what I=E2=80=99ve experienced, the trauma, or the need to heal. Instead, =
I was given marching orders, and one best not fall from that march, lest =
the consequences.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div =
class=3D"">But, I believe you know best. And I trust Lisa. If you both =
agree, I defer to your judgement. The only concern I have is attendance: =
if it=E2=80=99s only Todd, or Todd and Angie, then I don=E2=80=99t think =
it will help. Todd is trying, but his ability to deal with this is =
limited (as would mine be). He is there, and then not, and then there, =
and then=E2=80=A6 Angie and Todd both have partners, and they have very =
strong opinions. And again, they talk about me, but not too me. =
&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">All =
that said, it would be good for them to know what I am doing, who I am =

Cynthia more than anyone.&nbsp;</div><div class=3D""><br =

to.</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">By the =
way, I went to OAARS and they are going to try to fast track me to see =
