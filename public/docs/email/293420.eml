Well Alison, your client lied to you, or is so confused her =
psychological state should be examined. Did ya even read the =
correspondence? Because I assume you=E2=80=99re the one that is going to =
have to justofy it. I pasted it below. Take some time. look really =
closely, and you can just make out the differences between what you were =
told I said and did, and the realm of facts, the one we call reality.

And please excuse my boldness, but this letter is as waste of time. By =
now I would have assumed you would take care to confirm the veracity of =
her claims. I don=E2=80=99t appreciate the time wasted replying to =
fantasy, I don=E2=80=99t believe the courts do either. So a little fact =
checking, or asking me, could go along way to reducing the conflict. =
Unless that=E2=80=99s that=E2=80=99s her goal, which is the way it is =
looking.
=20
The fact is that she interfered with the girls time, and caused our =
daughters to feel afraid and anxious, and worried they won=E2=80=99t see =
me again, and upset if they are forced to see me less. A de facto =
arrangement of shared access has been in place for sometime now, which =
she arbitrarily changed Saturday, hours before I expected them, and my =
response was to continue in good faith too try to reason with her, and =
once again, ask her to talk to me like maybe I=E2=80=99m kind of their =
father, and maybe I had plans. She halted and reversed the progress we =
had made. Full stop. I talked to the girls, and they thought it should =
be fair, and took that into account. I told her exactly when they=E2=80=99=
d be returned, and did not spend more than 50% of their time with them.

But let=E2=80=99s get on track here: that story is rubbish, she set up a =
situation knowing it would expose the girls to drama they don=E2=80=99t =
need, and left them upset and worried. She sent me that threat just as I =
went to swim with my daughters. And by sheer coincidence, her sister had =
came to the beach knowing we were there, and for some reason was =
completely unprepared for the beach, so we shared sunscreen wth her and =
toys with her oldest son, and then they left as I went to go swim.

So can it really be claimed this is about the girls best interest?

Furthermore, after claiming that you and the police advised and =
supported this, she left two police officers annoyed at having their =
time wasted, and they said so. Your client appears ignorant of the fact =
that police do not make family law rulings, they do, however, enforce =
them, when appropriate. This was not, and the recognized that, =
disregarding your client=E2=80=99s demands. Until that time, she was =
parked beside the house for hours which made us uncomfortable, and =
Charlotte got to open the door to the face of her raging mad mother, who =
showed no interest in her and only want to get at me. Needless to say, =
Charlotte was upset after that, and I politely acknowledge that I am =
aware the police are going to be called, and asked her to resist further =
drama until they arrive.

The facts make clear that this was entirely avoidable, at several =
points. And at several points I tried to reason with her, which she =
refused to do. She refused my requests to meet or start to talk about =
the girls, which. I made over the summer, and has now demanded all =
correspondence related to this matter go through you, and seems to want =
this to escalate as much as possible. I wold only ask that to remind her =
that I remain open to a civil and focused conversation to work this out =
reasonably, and to restrict emails about these matters to after 8 pm =
when the girls are with me, or before 6:30 am, because this is a major =
cause of stress and distraction.

You are aware of the history of this case, and were involved in it from =
the start, so you know her affidavit wasn=E2=80=99t going to stand up in =
court because it wasn=E2=80=99t truthful or accurate. I document actual =
lies, not just inconsistencies or inaccuracies. And you also wrote the =
agreement we signed, which she is breaching and denying.=20

To make this quicker, here=E2=80=99s just a stat of the issues you may =
or may not know about, but are now on record:
We developed a status quo this summer, and have been sharing custody and =
access for a significant period of time, which the girls believed was =
permanent, as did I. And were given no warning of what she was planning =
as soon as her mom returned from vacation and was therefore available =
for the majority of the childcare.
Your client status those plans were not made recently, thus admitting to =
hiding them from the rest of us
She gave me no hint that she believed she had the authority or right to =
drastically restrict my access to the girls well after CAS said we have =
no concerns and recommend no restrictions, and then repeated that =
directly to your client
Primary residence has a very specific meaning, and that=E2=80=99s why =
there are separate words for custody and access, for example.
The girls have slept over regularly 3 or 4 nightss in a row. Once, she =
asked me to keep them 5 nights in a row for her convenience
She knew and was made aware I was moving to a place the girls could stay =
with me half time, as agreed, but waited until it was too late to tell =
me her plans, which she claims were made much earlier, thereby knowingly =
leaving me without housing or a place to see the girls, I.e., =
potentially homeless and estranged. Is that her goal?
Your client is on record saying really great things about me as a =
father, supporting more time, and actually encouraging it, and also on =
record denying saying any such things
Our agreement was written with the intent of enabling me to be able to =
afford the transition back to half time, which she now denies she ever =
agreed to
Until mere days ago she shared no concerns, and shared none with CAS, =
save one, mentioned below. Any new allegations will be highly suspect, =
or if real, show negligence on her part
She has caused me financial hardship knowingly and with malice. Housing =
and food and access to my daughters are rights, and she knowingly =
interfered with them, so I may be left with no option but to sue for =
damages.
Her decisions show a disregard for the feelings and desires of our =
daughters, and instead are directed toward me. Read the letter you just =
sent and compare it to the actual correspondence, and then try to =
explain how she prioritized the girls, and why she was forced to call =
the police
Her justification for this, her opposition to where I am moving, is she =
wrote to me, but one thing: sleeping arrangements. Yet to this very =
moment, just before I send this email, she has not asked what they will =
be. Not a single inquiry. Nor asked any other questions, important =
questions, like what=E2=80=99s the family like, is the house clean and =
safe? And when told I=E2=80=99d be happy to tell her the actual details =
if she=E2=80=99d like to know, she refused to reply. I even suggested =
she have her lawyer ask me.
To date you have not inquired, and at this point I=E2=80=99d be happy if =
she waited until court to ask. You know more than I do, but I=E2=80=99m =
sure judges have lots of time to waste, and welcome obfuscation, games, =
and just wasting court time.
She has been acting against the girls best interest. She did not tell =
them or ask how they feel when she starts restricting them from seeing =
me. They are used to this, wanted  it, and have come to count on it. =
They found out from me, and I, assuming any parent would have informed =
and prepared the children, was shocked they didn=E2=80=99t know, and =
they are upset, and don=E2=80=99t want it. They want to move with me 50% =
of time, and that deserves to one considered, let alone listened too.

I have told her I do not agree, I oppose it, and I don=E2=80=99t accept =
it, but there isn=E2=80=99t a single instance where I have ever used or =
threatened to keep the girls or withhold them outside of our agreement. =
She has, on several occasions, broken agreements we have made. This is =
documented. And your client is the is the only parent involved in this =
case who has ever done that.=20

Can you possibly understand how traumatic that was? Charlotte did not =
want to leave that morning, and I had a bad feeling, but I convinced her =
to go along with mommies plans, even though she wanted to stay with me. =
And every single time since we signed a custody agreement I still hide =
that piece of fear inside me, so the girls don=E2=80=99t feel it, and =
just hope that she won't do it again. I won=E2=80=99t do it because for =
many reasons, including because it=E2=80=99s wrong, selfish, and it =
hurts the girls. So too does the level of control she is forcing on us.=20=


She does not understand the difference or significance of primary =
residence, custody, and access, and misunderstood a clearly written =
court document, and expected the police to do as she bid. So I just =
barely had enough time to read it and recognize he was not in the right, =
and that was not warranted or necessary, and nor was there a claim of =
harm or safety that would warrant abruptly waking, confusing, upsetting, =
and scaring my daughters. Every step she takes makes the conclusion more =
and more obvious.=20

On the other hand, when read along with other documents we have signed, =
it can be used if she refuses reasonable access to the girls, or tries =
to take even more time away from me. That would be a justifiable reason. =
I have made my client aware of this (that=E2=80=99s me, of course). Your =
client should be made aware of this as well, and have no plans to =
restrict my access or ignore the rights that the girls have as well. It =
would clearly be an attempt to punish me.

She=E2=80=99s showing the same behaviour and thinking she did when she =
took them away last time, but I still stuck to my word and dropped them =
off as I said I would, and they were not with more me for a full 50%. I =
wouldn=E2=80=99t wish that on anyone, including your client.

I would appreciate it if confirmed with your client that she will =
continue as we have, in order not to disrupt the girls lives any =
further, and work this out as quickly as possible? This isn=E2=80=99t =
marriage counselling, Cynthia don=E2=80=99t have to share our feelings =
with each other, but we have to, at a minimum, come to a reasonable =
agreement about the girls, in a civil manner. Is your client truly =
incapable of that much?=20

Were I writing to her, I would strongly encourage her not to restrict my =
access to the girls, to minimize disruption to their lives, and remind =
her that no safety or security concerns have been raised, and that, in =
fact, I have not and will use or threaten to use the girls.

This needs to be settled as soon as possible, the escalation has no =
justification, and the further this goes, the more clear it becomes =
clear what her motives are and what she is willing to do.

Hi Darryl.

I do not agree with this arrangement and have consulted my lawyer and =
the police.=20

I will be at your home at 5 pm to pick up the girls. I will bring along =
my court order. Unfortunately if you do not release the girls to my care =
I will be calling the police.

I appreciate the small gesture, but once again you are dictating and =
restricting my rights and the girls. You are refusing to discuss with =
me, and I think it's time to move past that. I am open and flexible, but =
only within the limits of our custody agreement.

So after much consideration I have decided the most appropriate option =
you have left me is to contniue in good faith with the direction we =
agreed on, and the status quo we have established. The sudden change =
simply will not work, I won't have housing, and you still haven't taken =
the girls into consideration. As of now, the status quo has been about =
half time, and for several weeks. Your proposal is still an =
unjustifiable restriction to my access which would require a court order =
to enforce.

You have raised no justifications that can justify this decision, and =
have still not asked me, or asked your lawyer to ask me, how sleeping =
arrangments will be when I move. You are simply uninformed, and refuse =
to ask for information. This shouold have been raised and settled as =
soon as you found out I was moving, knowing that I was doing this =
following our agreement. The financial implications will leave me =
without housing.

But the primary concern is the girls. Charlotte sat on my lap for close =
to 15 minutes, at times sobbing, because she does not want to be forced =
to see me less. Neither of them do, and they are excited to move, and =
are planning on it. Up until you sent that email, there was no hint to =
me or the girls. I had to assume you told them, and was truly shocked =
that they found out from me.=20

I explained none of this is their responsibility or fault, and they =
aren't responsible for the decisions made, but I told them they have a =
right to express their feelings and wants, deserve to be asked, and that =
I will take them seriously. I hope you will do the same when you finally =
talk to them about this.

So, I'm emailing you directly so that you'll know that we have plans to =
go to the beach today we;re going to keep. It's our last chance this =
summer, we promised the girls, and probably won't make it back for =
swimming lessons. They both agreed, and want to go to the beach.

I am writing to inform you that I will follow what is now the status quo =
and what you, up to know, agreed to, and spend half their time with =
them, and no more. I will bring them to swimming lessons tomorrow, and =
expect you will be there to pick them up. Please confirm that you will =
be there so that I know.=20

I will alwats keep my promise not to take the girls from you, which you =
also made but did not keep. I  made that promise to the girls as well, =
which reassured them because they really don't want either of us to take =
them away, and they want to spend half their time with me. We came far =
without conflict or problems, until now. And you are taking the most =
extreme measures as your first choice. So, until we have a chance to =
work out a reasonable schedule, I expect you to cooperate and that I =
will spend time with them again no later than 4 days from when you pick =
them up tomorrow.

They are 5 & 7, they are worried about who will be in their class, the =
first day of school, and other kid worries. This is a big life worry you =
should not have put on them suddenly, or at this time. This should not =
have been a last minute change that upsets them and causes them to =
worry. It's not fair to them. Only you and I can make it easier for =
them, and I hope you will think about what is most imoprtant here, so =
that we can.
