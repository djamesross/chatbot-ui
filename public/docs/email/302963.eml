Yes, there is a letter. It contains almost nothing factual, and much that is=
 incorrect. I will forward it, and only it, to you right away.=20

I wanted very much to briefly describe the events immediately leading up to h=
er taking the children. I can do so briefly and factually in less than 5 min=
utes by phone, or in 6-8 written points when I arrive at my office at 1 pm, i=
f it would be helpful.=20
