Hi Darryl.

I am not agreeable to increase parenting time, or a change in supervision.
It's important to note, in 2022, I agreed to extend Sunday visits and since
the judgement I have provided consistent access to the girls even on
holidays and long weekends. They have only missed a visit due to illness in
which you called enforcement.

My lawyer is aware of my position.

Fortunately, Alice's practice with her team is on Sunday from noon-1 pm,
thus they will be dropped off at the same time as usual.

Charlotte will make up her 3-4 pm Sunday practice during the week for the
month.

The schedule will change from May-September once they are playing outdoors.
He explained practices will most likely not take place Sunday afternoons
but they will move to three times a week so Tuesday visits may have to
switch to another day.

Cynthia
