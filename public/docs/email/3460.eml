Hi Cynthia,

I have not agreed to change Sundays visit. What is Alice busy doing =
Monday afternoon?

We will have to agree to a make up time or alternative before letting =
Alice knows about Kenzie=E2=80=99s party.

Kindly let me know days and times in the next few days so we can make =
this work Alice.

Darryl
