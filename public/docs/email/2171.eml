What an incredibly vindictive little bitch! =C2=A0 =E2=80=8EAnd that's what=
 it is, of course: pure malice for having exposed her string of false accus=
ations for what they are.

So: no more trust, no more collaboration, no further negotiation.=E2=80=8E =
=C2=A0

And, just out of curiosity: what would happen if you said that you were not=
 comfortable with the kids being in her custody? After all, she's the one b=
eing dishonest here...

Subject: Boo!

Wooooo-hooooo=E2=80=A6.. Booooo!

Ok, so the good news is that my girls are sound asleep in their room. They =
are sleeping like babies. And I=E2=80=99m sitting in a rocking chair in the=
 room with them as I type this. (Well, to be honest, Alice is tossing and t=
urning, but that would only ruin the image that I hope to present. And Char=
lotte is snoring. And she just farted.)

The bad news is that I had to go to school early, face a hostile principal,=
 and watch Cynthia storm into the school before Charlotte even got out of h=
er class. It=E2=80=99s a long story, but the =E2=80=98deal=E2=80=99 that we=
 agreed to yesterday was a ploy. A strategy. They strung me along, told me =
that it was what they wanted, and then at 9 pm last night faxed my lawyer a=
 note saying that Cynthia is not comfortable letting the girls stay overnig=
ht with me. But by that time we had upheld our end of the bargain, and drop=
ped the urgent motion we had before the court.

Just to recap, I=E2=80=99ve been accused of truly horrendous crimes. Those =
claims were examined by the police, by the Children=E2=80=99s aid society, =
and by CHEO. Those claims were found to be baseless. I met with the CAS cas=
e worker and she told me that she sees no reason to withhold or restrict my=
 access to the girls. Cynthia's lawyer assured us that as soon as the Child=
ren=E2=80=99s Aid Society said that there are no concerns, we could move to=
 a shared parenting plan.=20

Well, lo and behold, when all the shit was shovelled out of the way, there =
was=E2=80=A6 you guessed it=E2=80=A6 more shit. (That metaphor is not as ef=
fective for those of you who are currently changing diapers, and so literal=
ly wiping shit. But still, I think it=E2=80=99s an effective literary devic=
e.)

Luckily by then, on the advice of my lawyer, we were safely ensconced in ou=
r home with chains on the door and a new code programmed into the garage do=
or opener. So we=E2=80=99re safe, but also in a kind of safe-house. (And we=
 just built a ginger bread house!) It=E2=80=99s not the relaxing and carefr=
ee weekend with the girls that I had hoped for, but with the girls I am. An=
d that, for now, is enough.

I will return them to school Monday morning, and Cynthia will pick them up =
Monday afternoon. After that, I cannot say. I will be there to pick them up=
 Wednesday afternoon, as per the spirit of our agreement. But regardless of=
 whether or not they are there, it seems very likely that I will have my da=
y in court. And if the gods are truly just, to smite will renter our modern=
 english lexicon.
