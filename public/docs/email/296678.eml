Hi Darryl,

I sent you an email from Alison.

Can you send me the evidence you have regarding your agreement for last Sun=
day? (text/email showing that she did not ask for your access to be supervi=
sed)

And yes the best thing you could do is wrap up with Heather and get the dis=
closure so we can take a look at it before we decide what to disclose.

I was preparing the affidavit, but things have obviously changed. What work=
 can I do now to help, aside from getting the charges from Will and closing=
 things with Heather? Is there any information I should collect, and should=
 I still be working on an affidavit?

I will start to write the disclosure, explaining why I'm off work, etc. But=
 if there is anything else I can do let me know.=20

Darryl
