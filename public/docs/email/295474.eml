Cynthia,

This has been such an extremely difficult time for us, and for our =
families. I want peace, more than anything. I am willing to involve you =
more in understanding my life if that helps, and I want to help you, =
too, in whatever way I can.=20

It was like an explosion went off, and I=E2=80=99m still working through =
it, but I think we can put many of the pieces back together. More and =
more I remember the good times that we shared, the connection, and how =
much we agreed. And then so much misunderstanding came up - we were both =
battling to understand our pasts, and it seems like we couldn=E2=80=99t =
be there for each other. Because we couldn=E2=80=99t. We were both =
carrying so much.=20

I want to ask you to try to work toward something better, for all of us. =
I truly am getting better, and working very hard at it. I want to share =
that with you, but we need to build some trust together.

I=E2=80=99ve realized how good of a mother you are; I realized through =
my mistakes.

I hope you give this some thought. It would be good to start to talk =
more. We can work these issues out, and we have help with CAS, Sharon, =
and other agencies. our family can thrive, but we need to step out of =
the legal system because it=E2=80=99s so confrontational. It=E2=80=99s =
always there if you  think it=E2=80=99s necessary, but we can try =
another way, a way that heals, and makes us all stronger.

This is the first email I=E2=80=99ve written start to finish without =
editing it, reviewing it, asking someone if it=E2=80=99s ok - or even =
re-reading it. It is from my heart, and for all that=E2=80=99s happened, =
it=E2=80=99s truly what I want.

Please give the kids hugs from me,

Darryl
