Cynthia,

I have not agreed to change my parenting time on Sunday 2-6 pm. I am =
offering an alternative so that you can take the girls during my =
parenting time.

Presently I=E2=80=99m being told that without discussion my parenting =
time Sunday is cancelled, and instead the children are being taken out =
of province. Where will they be? When are they leaving? =E2=80=A6when =
will they be back? =E2=80=A6is this going to be another denial of =
access? =E2=80=A6will this be another example of unlawfully withholding =
the children?=20

(With regard to my right to know where they will be, refer to your =
lawyer=E2=80=99s letter dated July 22, 2022)

These are very real concerns for me every time there is a sudden change, =
new plans, and especially while my repeated requests for information =
about where they are, who is taking care of them, health and medical =
information, activities they are in or that you are going to book them =
in, remain ignored to this date.

For these reasons and because of my and my mom=E2=80=99s availability =
I=E2=80=99m only agreeable to the following:

- Sunday, 2-6 pm, as scheduled, agreed on, and enforceable per the =
judge=E2=80=99s order, or
- Friday, noon-4 pm, in order to be flexible, as long as the girls can =
FaceTime me when they are back home Monday so I know that they have =
returned and my parenting time Tuesday won=E2=80=99t be interfered with.

Darryl
