Hi,

I'm hoping to open a dialogue with you the current restrictions, which the
girls an I are starting to find onerous, and which are could be perceived
as attempts at undue restrictions. If you force this to motion, amost other
things, I will be seeking make-up time.

It appears that you and your lawyer are relying on false assumptions which
may constitute libel, or have been misled. Nevertheless, it is worth
looking at case law available at
https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/nav_date.do,
http://www.ontariocourts.ca/decisions_index/en/, and
https://www.canlii.org/en/on/, as well as libraries. It is not my place to
direct you further.

Today. I will be a the college again until 2:30 pm preparing the final exam
and workig on a project. Thee fact that you refur to discuss with me acces
and custody, while stating that your parents find the weather difficult
runs contrary to your decision]

Further more it is an enriching environment that I am lucky to have access
to outside of regular hours, Monday 11-4, and which few people have the
experience with or been trusted to use the machinery in a safe way.

Be it known that to date youv'e made changes outside of your right to do
so, despite the recommendations of CAS.

It is time to cooperate for the sake fo or daughters or provide
jstifcsation why you are unable to.

Please escuse any grmmatical or typo errpr, but this is extemely sressful,
unecessary, and you show no indication that I have a life to live, or if
you do care devalue it.

I wouldl like o hear yiour conern so they can be addressed, but that
involves communication.

Darryl
