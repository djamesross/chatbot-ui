Hi Any,

I just realized my emails haven=E2=80=99t been going out. I=E2=80=99m =
having trouble with my laptop, and can=E2=80=99t use it right now.=20

Cynthia refused to release the girls this weekend, when they should have =
been with me. She=E2=80=99s claiming I wasn=E2=80=99t fit to take them, =
which is not true. I couldn=E2=80=99t bring myself to call the police =
though. I just couldn=E2=80=99t picture the police showing up, and the =
girls being involved. They=E2=80=99re with her today and tomorrow, but =
should be with me Wednesday. If she refuses again, would you recommend I =
call the police?=20

It=E2=80=99s been a hard weekend, and I really don=E2=80=99t know the =
best way to handle this.=20
