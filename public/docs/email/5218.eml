for 7. You have no reason, past behaviour or justification to suspect me of=
 trying to abduct them, which I would not do for them and which would sever=
ely hurt my position if I were foolish enough to do so. So that is no longe=
r a matter of concern, and in fact never was. Friday it would be great to h=
ave them spend time with me at the college. Your parents do not and have no=
t supervised for months, so a simple drop off and pick up is sufficient, bu=
t if one of them wants to sit somewhere and read a book that is fine. Sunda=
y I have booked tickets to see Frozen II, which we have been talking about =
since we first saw the trailer and the girls, as you heard this evening, ar=

 which is usually around the time I see them. However, as part of the trans=
ition I would like to spend more than just a the limits of the film, pickin=
