Hi Cynthia,

This is an ongoing issue of sickness and illness is an issues you have =
refused to resolve. Furthermore, the previous times that you withheld =
Alice it was clearly not necessary.

This is unlawful withholding and my only recourse is to, following the =
court order, contact Ottawa police.
