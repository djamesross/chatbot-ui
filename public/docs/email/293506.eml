Dear Ms. Boyce,

I repeat my request for information about my daughters. Following your =
client=E2=80=99s instructions, as per below, I kindly request =
information about my daughters health and well being on an on-going =
basis, as opposed to asking questions solely based on reaction.=20

This request is made in addition to my outstanding requests.=20

Best,

Darryl
