Hi Any,

I asked Cynthia for the girls for a family event today and she agreed as =
long as I don=E2=80=99t drink and agree that she picks up them up for =
bed. She didn=E2=80=99t ask for it to be supervised.

I=E2=80=99m considering keeping them, and then following the normal =
schedule, which would mean dropping them off at school and daycare =
tomorrow morning.

What do you think?
