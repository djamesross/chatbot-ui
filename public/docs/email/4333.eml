Hi Cynthia,

I would like to firm up plans for Christmas and winter break given that =
it=E2=80=99s coming so soon. I think having a full Christmas day with =
them is important and suggest that rather than splitting Christmas day =
up as it is we can alternate full days. I would be flexible about the 24 =
or 25th in that case. For the rest of their winter break extending the =
regular Tuesday visit to a full day makes sense, in addition to another =
day, which could be Thursday or Friday.

Please let me know as soon as possible if that schedule, depending on =
the days, works for you so I can coordinate on my end.

Darryl
