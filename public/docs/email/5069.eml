Hi Cynthia,

It's been great seeing the girls play soccer. Allowing extra time to play
with them at the park last Thursday was much appreciated.

As for dental insurance, I addressed the problem immediately. Sunlife
suggested suggested switching from direct deposit to mail as a solution. I
think it would easier if you kept me informed so that I could be sure this
won't happen again.

Darryl
