Hi,

The girl=E2=80=99s reminded me it=E2=80=99s father=E2=80=99s day this =
weekend. (I told them that I all I want is a drawing, or something they =
made - no need for anything else.)=20

Last night went well, and they were asleep a little before 8. I=E2=80=99m =
still on board with 7:30, and breaking the habit of trying to get every =
minute I could with them when it had to be so limited. But it=E2=80=99s =
feeling more and more normal, and easier to adjust to a regular =
schedule. This morning it was nice to have breakfast with them, and =
watch them get their lunches ready. They  should have everything with =
them or In the bag your mom had. If not, let me know.

For sleepovers I know things are difficult right now logistically, and =
that you want and need weekend time with them as well. For Sunday I=E2=80=99=
m going to plan a picnic, if the weather is nice, and was thinking a =
sleepover Saturday evening might work if they came over later, like a =
little before or after dinner. What do you think?

Darryl
