Hi Cynthia,

Thank you for getting in touch, I was just about to write to ask you for =
an update on Char=E2=80=99s fracture. Now she=E2=80=99s told me a =
fracture was confirmed based on X-rays last week, and that there may be =
a second.  Please update me on her fracture. And kindly keep me up to =
date about important issues.

With regard to child support, I have been in contact with FRO. Child =
support payments are a topic I was specifically told not to discuss with =
you. I was told to deal only with FRO or Ms. Boyce. That request was =
made by Ms. Boyce with you present, so I am surprised to hear directly =
from you and not to see her cc=E2=80=99ed on this email.=20

There is outstanding child support owing, and I do intend to catch up as =
I can. Unfortunately, as you may recall, there was a very expensive and =
unnecessary motion brought to stop me from having parenting time with =
our daughters, or any relationship. It cost a lot of money to confirm =
that they were being unlawfully withheld. Perhaps one thing we can agree =
now is that any money I receive is better spent on child support, and =
supporting our daughters.

I will advise as necessary and when possible.

Darryl
