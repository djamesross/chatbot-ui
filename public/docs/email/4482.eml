Hi Darryl,

I wanted to provide you with an update after the court appearance this =
morning.

Justice Kershman has signed our Temporary Order pursuant to the Minutes =
of Settlement. However, he was unsure if all of the pertinent documents =
were in the court file to issue (i.e. stamp) and sign the Divorce Order =
so he did not sign it. Therefore, I will have one of my colleagues check =
the court file tomorrow and send you a copy of the temporary order and =
the divorce order once I receive same.

Justice Kershman did require a timeline of when you would provide the =
remainder of the disclosure required. Therefore, he has ordered that you =
need to provide the outstanding documentation by July 13, 2018 (i.e. 30 =
days from today).

Please do not hesitate to contact me in writing should you have any =
further questions.

Sincerely,
Alison =20
