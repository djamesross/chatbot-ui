Hi Cynthia,=20

I agree that is the priority. To contribute I will need receipts from =
all of the activities they=E2=80=99ve been in, and to make sure I can =
afford new ones please let me know before commiting them so I can let =
you know if I can afford it, and budget for it.

As for the gifts, they are all things I=E2=80=99ve had here or in =
storage, except for the rainbow light. For the most part I like to give =
them things I=E2=80=99ve made, or picked up on sale over time.=20
