I know, and I=E2=80=99m worried. The only good part is that Denyse told =
me not to bring it up with CAS, but to tell our therapist and doctor, =
because it=E2=80=99s a real issue, and if someone else  brings it up, =
CAS will have to investigate and find problems there, and maybe make =
recommendations - as long as I don=E2=80=99t go to CAS myself. They =
didn=E2=80=99t, but this police officer will (and not because we=E2=80=99r=
e friends - we just just know each other).

So=E2=80=A6 I=E2=80=99m thinking it=E2=80=99s bad, I=E2=80=99m going to =
look like shit, but CAS may go into her house, and maybe help the kids.=20=


Or so I hope.
