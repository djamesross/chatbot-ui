Hi Darryl,

I am not present from 4-5 pm on Thursday as I am still at the office so
relying on Charlotte to coordinate. After I read your email I spoke to her
and she said she talked to you  briefly and said they will call you Friday
after school. I am not sure where the miscommunication happened. Again they
never miss FT and if so they always reschedule.

Alice has mentioned at times she is not up to speaking with you over FT but
she says she is made to feel guilty, she says when you have an in
person visit you speak to her about why she is not up to speaking at length
and she says she is made to feel bad.  If this is accurate, please stop
this immediately.

Cynthia
