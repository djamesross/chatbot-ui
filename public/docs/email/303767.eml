Hi Cynthia,

I=E2=80=99m following up from your email below about driving two trips =
each week and reducing supervised visits to once weekly. This past week =
worked out perfectly with my mom driving Tuesday. Of four trips per week =
my mom made two of them, as you requested. The sun sets later now, =
already after 7 pm and getting later each day, also addressing one of =
the concerns you raised.=20

My mom is asking if she can do the driving on Tuesdays to reduce the =
amount of driving she has to do each week. She=E2=80=99s done a lot over =
the past 20 months, diving in twice a week, every week, from Smiths =
Falls to Ottawa and back each time, but she only drives the girls once =
each trip. It=E2=80=99s a huge amount of time and expense for my mom. =
She drives past your place each time anyhow, so it just makes sense for =
her to pick up the girls on her way in once each week and drop them off. =
She=E2=80=99s also got Vic now to help take care of, and it=E2=80=99s =
not clear how much he=E2=80=99s going to improve.

Please let me know if Tuesdays will work.

Darryl

<br>
The forecast is calling for as much as 100 cm of snow between about 3 pm =
and 8 pm which is too much for my mom to drive tonight on highways and =
country roads. The local roads will likely be bad too. She is available =
Wednesday or Thursday.<br>
<br>
If the local roads are drivable I propose they be dropped off and picked =
up this evening as usual. Visits have been supervised for 1.5 years now =
and I think it=E2=80=99s time to move to unsupervised visits based on =
the record of the last 18 months of perfect visits. (For comparison, in =
2018 following the direction of CAS they started after one month, so =
it=E2=80=99s been 18x longer). If they are bad, I propose starting =
unsupervised visits Wednesday or Thursday as alternatives.<br>
<br>
Please let me know:<br>
- if you are agreeable to moving to unsupervised visits at this time (or =
by the end of this month, January, 2024)<br>
- which evening works best: Wednesday or Thursday<br>
