> Hey there, so glad to see the girls had a nice time with you. I ran =
through their hair and both still have the bugs and eggs so I will =
tackle it tonight.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> The girls only have 3 weeks left of school so it=E2=80=99s a bit of a =
mixed bag on visits. I was thinking for this week you could have them =
Thursday after school until Friday at 430 pm and then Sunday as per =
usual. Girls have plans Saturday and Sunday morning. Also I need to =
double check this but gymnastics on Saturday may be parent day so we =
could meet you there and both participate.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> How does that work for this week?
>=20
>=20
>=20
> Thursday your Mum would have to pick up after school as my mom is =
away.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> Hey, I was so happy they did too. It was really, really nice to have =
them over again. Sorry to hear the lice are still there. I=E2=80=99ll =
keep working on it as much as I can too.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> Plans for next weekend sound good, but what do you think of them =
staying over until Saturday morning? The Centerpointe garage sale is =
Saturday morning, and I think the girls would enjoy it. (They each have =
a five dollars saved they could spend). You could meet us somewhere =
around here mid-morning, if it worked out. Again, if you wanted to stop =
by to check in Friday after work or evening, I=E2=80=99m comfortable =
with that.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> As for this week, did you mean to switch days to Thursday, from =
Wednesday? If so, that shouldn=E2=80=99t be a problem now that classes =
are done.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> Ok, two days makes me a bit uncomfortable but I can check on them. A =
concern of mine is their sleep routine at night. As you they need good =
rest. Can you commit into having them in bed and reading books both =
nights by 730? I find it they stay up late , then their routine is off =
and it=E2=80=99s really difficult for me to get them back to =
bed/routine. Would that work for you going forward?
>=20
>=20
>=20
> I think if you see them more regularly and establish a tighter routine =
then that will benefit all to us and make me feel more comfortable.
>=20
>=20
>=20
>=20
> I understand, which is why I didn=E2=80=99t ask about an extra night =
this last weekend. I know it=E2=80=99ll take steps. I agree about =
bedtime, and like a solid bedtime routine too, and 7:30 was always the =
latest they=E2=80=99d be in bed when they were with me. They were down a =
little late this weekend, but it was the first sleep over here, and we =
took time to set up their bed, get the lighting right, bathroom night =
light, etc. They are used of either leaving here just before 7:30, or =
being picked up, so I=E2=80=99ll use that as a routine for bedtime.
>=20
>=20
>=20
> It was definitely a lot more comfortable this weekend, coming and =
going. We had time to just do things, and hang around. They were a lot =
more relaxed, and seem to be so more and more. Going normal is a really =
good feeling. And I agree having the same routine will help.
