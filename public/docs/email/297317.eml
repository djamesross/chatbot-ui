Hi Lynda,=20

I=E2=80=99m aware of Cynthia=E2=80=99s claims, but they are second hand, and=
 not accurate. I was not drinking.=20

I=E2=80=99ll check my emails when home, but we agreed last week that Todd wo=
uld supervise each Sunday from 11-1, starting next week, and her mom would s=
upervise Thursday after school. I am confused because we have this in writin=
g. I=E2=80=99m meeting with my sister this week and hope to set up one more t=
ime (as agreed in court - three visits).=20

It might be best to talk. I=E2=80=99m currently on the picket line, but coul=
d call after 4:30, or set up a time tomorrow.=20

Let me know,

Darryl=20
