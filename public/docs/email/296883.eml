Hi Any,

I was in court with Will yesterday and it went better than expected. He was g=
reat, and the judge was very compassionate. I've also seen Dr. Douglass and D=
r. Milstone. After making them aware of exactly what I'm struggling with, th=
ey are still both fully supportive of me. Dr. Milstone in particular, and sh=
e is going to contact Dr. Douglass. She also spoke to Heather, with full kno=
wledge of my personal situation, and told me that Heather was very sympathet=
ic, said she would be closing the case.

Dr. Milstone has done custody assessments, and worked with/was trained by Dr=
. Leonoff and Dr. Harrison, and said she's confident it will be a positive o=
utcome.=20

All that said, I still feel like I owe you an explanation. Do you have any t=
ime to chat this afternoon?

Darryl=
