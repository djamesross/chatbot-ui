We have a parenting agreement. I gave you some space yesterday, hoping =
it would calm things down, but we have to stick to our agreement going =
forward.

Those emails were not intentional. I=E2=80=99ve never sent anything like =
that before, and I think it=E2=80=99s obvious I=E2=80=99m having =
computer problems (which is why I=E2=80=99m typing on the iPad now). I =
assumed that would be obvious.

As for this morning, are you going to refuse to let me take the girls?

Darryl
