Cynthia

Please be careful about diagnosing someone.
Darryl's stuttering etc is not caused by an addiction...but appears when he
is extremely nervous and is expecting added stress as you did when you
walked into his space yesterday unannounced.

He stuttered as a young boy and I understand this can return under extreme
stressful circumstances  such as what he has gone through in the last few
years.

Interesting that he settles right down and stuttering  stops when he is
with the girls.  Hes had to fight so hard ...  just to parent for a long
period now that these symptoms dont surprise me.

But none of us have reported these "symptoms" when the girls are with him.

I wish you would believe the children are my priority.

Having said this I believe Darryl needs more time with them, not less.  And
this would be better for the girls, as well.

A different approach is necessary.
The present one would bring out anxiety in any of us
Everyone needs to stop assuming the worst.

In the meantime Darryl will touch base with the Dr about these symptoms.
