Hi Jane,

I=E2=80=99ve sort of frozen up on this issue. The events, our life, =
marriage, all of it, feels so overwhelming.=20

The girls absolutely love to eee me, come running, and we hug and talk =
and play the whole time. After the debacle where Cynthia threatened =
supervised access sites, not a word has been said but her parents have =
continued to supervise. However, now that the weather is cold they spend =
upwards of 80% of the time  in their car, out of site. There is clearly =
no fear of me fleeing with the girls.=20

Also, is it not incumbent upon the parent seeking supervised access to =
prove their case? And is it not a case about the child=E2=80=99s right =
to have maximum time with their parents (me).=20

I have been afraid to look thought the documents, just feeling =
overwhelmed I=E2=80=99ll find something that will cause me to lose them. =
But I=E2=80=99ve been reading law books and journals and it seems nearly =
unprecedented for a mother to, on her own and against CAS =
recommendations, such radical restrictions.

Furthermore, as the weather gets colder her parents are willing to do =
less. But should this not be about them or me, but about the girl=E2=80=99=
s rights?=20

I need to bring a motion as soon as possible. It=E2=80=99s been long =
already, I=E2=80=99m facing financial hardship, and the girls are =
telling more about how things are not going well at their mother=E2=80=99s=
 house.=20

She has: unjustified claims, including people who have had no contact =
with me since I quick drinking. I have letters from addiction =
counsellor, family dr. Dr. Willows, head of additions at the Royal who =
completely reversed her extended intreatementn as was very happy with =
how I am doing.

What if she claims it=E2=80=99s a temporary measure to overcome a =
cautious custodial parent, which would undermine the argument that the =
onus is on her. Except that we have the summer, cooperation, test, =
emails, and on and on.

I=E2=80=99m meeting with them tomorrow 1 to 3, not at 11 as I initially =
said. But I understand if you want to wait until Monday.

Thank you again.
