Hi Cynthia,

I was just booked for an MRI that is tomorrow, so I won=E2=80=99t be able t=
o meet
your schedule and FaceTime with them at 5 pm. I miss them so much, and
don=E2=80=99t want to lose what little contact you have decided I can have.=
 While I
disagree with your dramatic reduction in contact between me and the girls,
which is not in the girls best interest, it is important for them that we
maintain contact. I can call at 4 pm. I hope that works.

Also, I=E2=80=99d really like to know how schooling is going for them. As a=
n
educator, I=E2=80=99m really invested in how they are doing, and would real=
ly like
to contribute. Or, at the very least, have visitation following the
standing court order. If you want to supervise that=E2=80=99s fine, but it=
=E2=80=99s
important for the girls to have their father in their life, and for me to
have a relationship with them. And I miss them so much, and don=E2=80=99t
understand why you=E2=80=99ve decided that such drastic restrictions are ne=
cessary.

Please keep me up to date on their schooling, health, and well-being. Is
anything new or changed? I know you don=E2=80=99t want to talk to me, but i=
t=E2=80=99s not
about what you or I want, it=E2=80=99s about the girls=E2=80=99 best intere=
sts.

Bringing motions, arguing contempt of court, paying lawyers, its all a
waste of time and money. After all that=E2=80=99s happened I=E2=80=99m full=
y capable of
being amicable and agreeable, for the sake of the girls, and I think you
are too.

Darryl
