        I hope we can talk and Wednesday afternoon or when ever works for y=

        However, I must begin with the following: you began you last note a=

aven't apologized or accepted my feelings about your drinking, exhibitionis=
m and inappropriate behaviour. I've taken distance because you are an alcoh=

 is why I've taken some healthy distance.

         I am afraid my responses will continue to disappoint you, given th=
at a pre-condition of yours appears to be that I accept and apologize to yo=
u for  your conclusions that as your dad I was an exhibitionist and engaged=
 in inappropriate sexual behaviour around you as well as well as being a ch=

caricature of who I am and have been, not a character sketch, a demonizatio=

with you and toward those I love.

Your description is not a mirror in which I recognize myself nor my actions=
 as your dad nor who I am. I would betray myself, my memories and my histor=
y with you if I accepted your allegations and insinuations. I in no way am =
denigrating your feelings about your memories and I believe you have an abs=
olute right to your own narrative. I believe I do as well.
         As to your emphasis on my drinking, or as you prefer repeatedly to=
 call it 'alcoholism', I told you I quit some months ago. I am not interest=
ed in dragging Thuy or others I love into your issues with me and told Thuy=
 that this week when we had lunch. She seemed unaware (or claimed to be) of=
 the hurt I apparently have caused her.
