Hi Cynthia,

It=E2=80=99s unfortunate that George's friend passed away so quickly and
unexpectedly, but I won=E2=80=99t let that interfere with Charlotte=E2=80=
=99s birthday. We
both love and want the best for her and in this troublesome time she really
needs the love and attention that we can give her for her birthday. I
understand that you took her to an RV somewhere and I assume you celebrated
her birthday there or at a later date, so this will be my opportunity to
celebrate my daughter's birthday. Moving on from the past, I think given
that you are not willing to allow any contact, this is the best option, and
I really appreciate that you agreed to it so willingly.

What I mentioned at the park is a very positive and progressive program put
on by the city of Ottawa. I've signed up for the fall session and typically
the other parent signs up for the winter session. However, there is no
pressure on you to follow through, nor is it mandatory to take the course.
I merely want to give you the information and make you aware of it because
I think it could help us communicate better, which would benefit the girls,
who are the most important people that we have to think about.

It was kind of you to offer to set up the projector and make it a
celebration at your home and to be involved. I hope we can reach that level
one day, but when I spoke to the social worker who runs the program
mentioned above, and she realized I was banned from celebrating Charlotte=
=E2=80=99s
birthday based on your assessment and would trespass were I to see her, she
suggested that this would cause Charlotte anxiety and discomfort and that
it would be best to allow Charlotte and Alice privacy during this time.
Their room, or a space where they won=E2=80=99t be interrupted, is ideal, s=
he said.
It isn=E2=80=99t likely to last over two hours. I=E2=80=99m not asking that=
 you give us
complete privacy, only that you allow us time together. Listen in or watch
from a distance by all means, I only ask that you give Charlotte the space
to engage with me and her grandmother without interruption and for her not
to feel uncomfortable.

You=E2=80=99d mentioned the weekend was open. Saturday afternoon, after 3 p=
m works,
or anytime Sunday.

Best,

Darryl
