Ok. Lets plan for a park visit. Saturday at 1pm for an hour or so? Regatta
or HMB?

  I can pick up Charlotte's bike, could you also include some cothes for
Charlotte? She is asking for her  skirts (mostly jean) and shorts and any
Ts and some dresses. Alice seems fine with her 3 flower dresses:)

I like the idea of you seeing the boys and agree it should be slow.

They could do Tuesday morning too, 930-1130 at a park and perhaps Thursday
morning too.
