felt pain worse than any physical trauma I have yet received. All I can I s=
ay is holy fuck that hurt. And jesus-fucking-christ I would rather suffer a=
 compound fracture. Only a few people truly understand that I was both moth=

 with my lawyer (as my bill reveals, hence my tight purse of late). I follo=
wed up every lead that I could (I joked about billing them but am consideri=

S. I worked up a detailed timeline, I plotted her claims, versus my evidenc=
e, and cross-referenced the audio recordings. As for the authorities, Cynth=
ia called them all. The police never followed up, CHEO found no signs of se=

attending nurse, who helped me decipher the medical record, and sopped up m=

</span><br>&#62; Now, up to that point Cynthia was sticking to her guns: sh=
e was &#8220;only following&#8221; the investigation, and asked only that w=
e wait for the investigation to run it&#8217;s course. Only when I met with=
 the CAS did they reveal that they never had cause for concerns, beyond her=
 accusations. (And there were so many more lies too&#8230;) So with that ou=
t of the way, she happily&#8230; made up new excuses. Yes, she did.<br>&#62=
