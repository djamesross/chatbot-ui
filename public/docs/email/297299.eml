Hi Lynda,

I=E2=80=99m very sorry, but I can=E2=80=99t make it to you in time, and =
prepare my course for tomorrow morning. The bus ride alone is close to 2 =
and a half hours both ways.

I am free tomorrow, Thursday from noon to 3 pm, and Friday after 1 pm.

I will also try to get that letter from Dr. Willow. Did you try faxing a =
request for it?

Darryl
