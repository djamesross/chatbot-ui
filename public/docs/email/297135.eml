I just spoke to Heather Clark, the CAS worker assigned to the case. She told=
 me that a complaint was made by someone who did not want to be identified. B=
ased on the nature of the complaint they have a duty to investigate, but tha=
t at this point it is nothing more than a risk and assessment investigation (=
she just does assessments).=20

She met with Cynthia, Ben, and the girls this morning. She said that they ar=
e doing very well, and mentioned that Charlotte seems to be happy and unawar=
e of what's going on.=20

The complaint was made against me, citing mental health concerns, alcohol co=
nsumption, and unhealthy boundaries with the children.=20

The earliest that she can meet me is Monday, so we made an appointment at 9 a=
m. She does not have a copy of the medical records, so I offered to send her=
 a copy (please let me know if that was a bad idea for any reason).=20
