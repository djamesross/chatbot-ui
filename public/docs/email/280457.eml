Hi Darryl,

Here is an update on the girls.

Charlotte has sprained her ankle again and is on crutches and a boot. X-ray
shows no sign of broken.

In January I will be taking her to another physiotherapist to look at the
issue and evaluate her ergonomically as well. Right now she is doing her
practices and getting stronger.

She is registered for basketball with her BFF so we are just waiting for
her to heal. She is doing well at school and has some great friends. She
does have a lot of separation anxiety and trauma so she is seeing a
therapist to help her deal with it.


Alice is doing really well this year, she is taking an art class and
flourishing in it. She also has made some close  BFFs and is enjoying
school and her friends and fam. Her studies are great, the only area she
needs to work on is reading so we are practicing at home.

She does have some anxiety when I am away so I am working with her to ease
some of it.


I am away this Friday for a week in aCuba with my friend. My neighbour
Maureen is staying with the girls this weekend and next week they are
staying with school friends , Michelle and Matt are great with them and
they feel comfortable and safe there. Maureen is getting some help from my
mom. The girls care for Maureen and are very happy to be staying in their
own home this weekend.

I will send the therapist information. I will be offline for a week so will
respond back when I return.

Cynthia
