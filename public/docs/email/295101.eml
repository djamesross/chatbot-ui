Yes, and I agreed about summer plans, and said so. But also wanted to =
acknowledge that it must have been difficult for you to make plans =
because of my condition. That is all. I have no criticism.

But in terms of the house, the girls are safe and secure here. We are =
active, and do a lot, including downtime. It is a clean, but not =
spotless home. I=E2=80=99ve explained what I value, and do not have the =
means to pay for a cleaner. I=E2=80=99m just renting, or would have =
scrubbed it top to bottom long ago, but as long as it=E2=80=99s not a =
sanitary or health concern, I feel I=E2=80=99m better spending my time =
on more important things.  I was extremely happy to have them over a =
second night last weekend, and glad we=E2=80=99re at the point you were =
conformable doing that. But please remember we had less than 10 minutes =
notice you were arriving, so it was a rush.

So much has changed - it used to be short visits, focused only on as =
much quality time as possible. Now it=E2=80=99s transitioning back to a =
parenting role, and that brings changes. I have started a habit where I =
ask them to pack everything they need or want to bring with them a half =
hour before being picked up, so there isn=E2=80=99t a rush to find =
things when the door bell rings. That wasn=E2=80=99t possible Sunday  - =
which is totally fine, but should be taken into consideration. The  =
girls have both said  they like it here. You may not, which is fine -and =
we=E2=80=99d probably agree on many things if we took a walk through the =
house. A few things actually bug me, but they=E2=80=99re a matter of =
taste or preference, not sanitation, mental health, or safety. I would =
like to be in a much better position, but that will not be possible for =
a long time, so I am trying to do the best I can, and make the most with =
what I have.

I=E2=80=99m glad we=E2=80=99re talking about this, between you and I, =
but  because this has brought up past feelings related to when I was =
drinking, I  encourage you to  raise the issue with Jennifer, or any =
past case-worker we=E2=80=99ve worked with. If they have concerns or =
advice on how my house may  negatively affects the girls I will follow =
their suggestions. But I do know the girls were happy, enjoying =
themselves, and really liked having you come in the house and show you =
some things. I was cringing, because it=E2=80=99s an old habit to allows =
appear neat and tidy, but I am glad you did come in, because it mattered =
to them.

So to recap, when I know when they=E2=80=99re being picked up I am =
teaching them to learn to care for what they need and want to bring, and =
I=E2=80=99m helping while slowing doing less so they learn it=E2=80=99s =
going to be solely their job some day. Filth, dirt, old food, etc., is =
not acceptable here and would be cleaned right away. You saw the result =
of two days of crafts, playing, going through toys (I am moving =
soon...), dancing, and playing games. A mess it was, but a happy mess, =
put away binds shortly after they left.

And I regret mentioning anything to you about family issues. I certainly =
was not going to involve you in any way. In fact my goal was the =
opposite: the only goal I had, and I thought it was the right thing to =
do at the time, was to give you a head=E2=80=99s up that one or more of =
them may try to to bring you in to create drama, so you=E2=80=99re not =
caught off guard. It=E2=80=99s been done before, so I wanted to cut it =
off before it cold happen. No details, just a head=E2=80=99s up. But now =
that I know you don=E2=80=99t want to hear anything, I will respect =
that.

I=E2=80=99ll have them ready for 4 pm, as usual, and we have a busy day =
until then, so we=E2=80=99ve got to get moving!
