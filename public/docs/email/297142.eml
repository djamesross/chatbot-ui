Hi Any,

Here are some points that might become significant when we get the =
documents from her lawyer. I have emails and texts to support most if =
not all of these points:
during the Fall of 2014, Cynthia =E2=80=98discovered=E2=80=99 that she =
had been sexually abused by her father. She also discovered that he was =
an alcoholic. He has and continues to, deny both accusations. Since 2014 =
Cynthia has not met with him. Only the boys, Ben and Sam, have had =
limited interaction with their grandfather.
Cynthia shared with me that she was =E2=80=98abused sexually=E2=80=99 =
and =E2=80=98mistreated' during her first long term relationship, with =
Ryan Ellson
In September of 2015, Cynthia =E2=80=98discovered=E2=80=99 that she was =
sexually assaulted by a male friend during her high school graduation=20
Cynthia has consistently stated that her previous partner, Scott =
Leclair, had a drug addiction. She claims that his doctor referred him =
to a rehab program, and this contributed to the end of their =
relationship, and to the limited custody that he has.
Cynthia has recently discovered that her mother neglected her as a =
child. She has been struggling with how to approach her mother, and =
recently told me that she needed time away from her, and limited =
contact.
Darryl
