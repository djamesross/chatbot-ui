Ya, that=E2=80=99s great. I figured you might want to bring them there =
for dinner, but forgot to mention it.

I also meant to mention those lunch kits are really cool. There are so =
many that are stylish but don=E2=80=99t work well, or the spaces make no =
sense. It was really easy for the girls to do most of the packing.
