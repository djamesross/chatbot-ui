Hi Cynthia,

Yes I will. I=E2=80=99ve been trying to collect the documents I need to give=
 her, and don=E2=80=99t have a printer or scanner (they=E2=80=99re buried in=
 a storage locker). I hope to have them to her by late Thursday/early Friday=
. I=E2=80=99m committed to this, but slow because I have to figure things ou=
t as I go.

I did get her email, and am waiting for some information about how to get so=
me of the documents. I=E2=80=99ll get back to her either way by 1 pm, and le=
t her know what I=E2=80=99ve got and when I can get the rest.

Darryl
