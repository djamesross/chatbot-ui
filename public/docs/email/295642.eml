Hi,

I emailed your mom about this week, and cc=E2=80=99ed you. I start work =
next week, but next weekend I=E2=80=99m planning to go to Ajax =
(Friday-Tuesday). Your mom mentioned that the girls will be in swimming =
lessons next week. If so I was thinking that I could pick them up from =
your mom=E2=80=99s and drop them off by bike (Ali on the trail-a-bike), =
from Wednesday-Friday. Would that work for you?
