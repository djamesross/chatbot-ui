Hi Cynthia,

There have been many times when you have cancelled, changed or =
interfered with scheduled parenting-time following the judges order, all =
of which you were willing to make up until today. I=E2=80=99m not sure =
whether to be confused and concerned right now because a number of =
issues seem to be coming up that are red flags.

To focus on the issue at hand, your position was that you agree to make =
up missed parenting time and always have, and more specifically you =
agreed to make up the time that you (today) don=E2=80=99t agree to do. =
That was your position and you already agreed, so why are you =
disregarding your own agreement and refusing to do something you agreed =
to do? =20

As for this past Sunday my mom was late by two hours. I let you know as =
soon as she called me, and you were in contact with her during that =
time. You already agreed to make up missed time so this makes no sense =
to me. Why should Char and Ali lose the parenting time they clearly =
value and enjoy based on flawed logic? I can totally understand why you =
don=E2=80=99t want or care to make up parenting time for me, but =
parenting-time is a right of children. Your reasons make no mention of =
them and that concerns me.

I hope we can find a time that works and that this doesn=E2=80=99t =
become a problem again.

Darryl
