Hi Any,

I hope you had a good weekend, and that your wrist is healing up. It=92s =
hard to imagine nothing else got hurt though - I hope you=92ve been =
doing well.

I had a great weekend with the girls. We spent Saturday night in a =
chalet with a bunch of family, which was a nice treat.

Interesting, as we were driving home this afternoon, I saw Cynthia =
pulling out of her new address, so it=92s not such a secret anymore. =
It=92s not as close as I thought it might be, but it is only 1.5 km =
away,or about a 5 minute walk. It=92s right off of a main road, across =
from Sam=92s school, and the local rec centre, where Charlotte had =
swimming lessons. It=92s also at at lest $200 less per month than Brian =
said it was (I googled the address, and the old ad came up).=20

Seriously Any, I am getting sick of being nice, and playing by the =
rules, and being extra nice, when all she=92s done is lie. Aside from =
all of her allegations - which are vicious and damaging and crazy - =
there was the first parenting schedule that we agree too only to find =
out she changed her mind, and now the rent she pays is a lie too.

It just doesn=92t stop.

Given her bad faith bargaining, and lies, there is no way I can pay more =
than 50% of the housing costs. In fact, I think I should pay less. I =
plan on telling her later tomorrow that she has to pay 50%, and then =
waiting a day or two to tell her that I won=92t list the house for less =
than what we need to break even (555,000k). It won=92t sell for that, =
but at least I won=92t be going into debt, the girls can keep their home =
for a while, and it will put pressure on her. (And in the meantime, =
she=92s kindly asked me to move all of the boys=92 furniture, and =
include Alice=92s crib, and on and and on=85 And she won=92t even =
acknowledge the division of contents).

As always I=92ll wait to hear your advice before I do anything,

Darryl
