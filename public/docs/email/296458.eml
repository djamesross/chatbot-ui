Hi Any,

It=E2=80=99s been eerily quiet, but for reasons that now make sense. I =
have it on good authority that Cynthia did in fact call the police after =
we sent our letter. However, the police told her that they would not =
send a cruiser to our house, because there is nothing that they can do =
without a court order. I have also learned - again, on good authority - =
that she now understands that her lies have fallen on=E2=80=A6 I was =
going to say deaf ears, except that the authorities have listened, as =
they should have, but that they have decided that she is simply not =
credible. In other words, she now appears to know that the jig is up.

Finally, a rumour through the grapevine suggests that she is going to =
ask for a week-on, week-off schedule. Apparently she is going to ask for =
this because, and this is the truly amazing part, she has now entered =
into a shared custody agreement with Scott, the boys=E2=80=99 father, =
following a week-on, week-off schedule (I have yet to confirm this, but =
am fairly certain based on the source.) As you know, he is the =
emotionally abusive, possibly sexually abusive, father, that she pulled =
access away from, a scant 6 months ago (based on legal advice from Diana =
Carr). As you and I discussed, it is not in the best interests of our =
daughters to move to a 7-day rotation. 7 days is an eternity at that =
age. But, again, this shows Cynthia=E2=80=99s priorities - she would =
rather have a nice, neat schedule, with 7 days off for herself, than be =
a real parent.

As I reflect back on the last 21 days, there are so many highlights. But =
a few things are starting to gain prominence: she told me to give her =
back the van and the house, and she told me that I will be paying child =
support. But only recently we find out that she has secured a rental =
property, and that she expects me to take on the full costs of our =
house. And she still wants the van. I can tell you that I am not in a =
position to take on the full cost of this house. It was more house than =
we should have bought, and we bought it because she had to have it.My =
financial priorities right now are day-to-day expenses, paying for my =
(excellent) legal services, and establishing myself in a home that fits =
the needs of me and the girls. That is it, and I cannot do more.

As always, I await your advice. But based on what=E2=80=99s happened so =
far - including the fact that she has acted in bad faith, submitted an =
affidavit full of=20
lies, and has never acted in the best interests of the children, I am =
not in a bargaining mood. Not unless she is willing to make serious =
concessions. As it stands, I won=E2=80=99t settle for less than sole =
custody. And  I will not take over the costs of the house - I just =
can=E2=80=99t justify the financial position it would put me in.

The more that I think about the situation, the more that I want to take =
a hard-line. It=E2=80=99s not a matter of punishing her, or getting back =
at her. She=E2=80=99s already as crazy-hating as she can be about me. =
But the girls need a clear schedule, a routine, and a parent that is =
acting in their best interests. And they need a mom who knows there are =
limits to how she can treat people.

For now, I understand she wants to remove stuff from the house Monday. =
Do you think I should stay while she=E2=80=99s here? (I can do it =
without getting upset.)=20

And as for this meeting, is this similar to mediation - can what we say =
or do be used in court?

Darryl
