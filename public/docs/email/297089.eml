Hi Any,

My girls are sleeping peacefully in their beds. They both went down like =
angels. I am so happy to have them home again, and I=92m excited for the =
next three days. We are going to have fun!

I want to give you a re-cap of the day. And what a stressful day it=92s =
been...

To start, I am very concerned about the principal=92s behaviour. When I =
asked to picked up Charlotte at the front desk, the admistrator =
immediately found the principal, who spoke to me before they would call =
Charlotte. She asked me if anything had changed, or if there was a =
parenting plan. I told her no, but that I have the same rights as =
Cynthia, and that either of us can pick her up. She told me that I=92m =
putting her in a difficult position, and that she doesn=92t want the =
school involved. She asked if we should call Cynthia, and I said no, I=92m=
 her parent, and I=92m picking her up. But I also told her that we =
agreed that I would pick Charlotte up this afternoon (it was the part =
after 6 pm that we did not agree on). But lo and behold, not 5 minutes =
later Cynthia stormed in the front doors. (And it would take at least 20 =
minutes to get to the school from her work or from her parent=92s home - =
so she was waiting near-by.) She confronted me and told me that I have =
no right to be there, and that this is not what we agreed on. I didn=92t =
say much, and to be honest I didn=92t feel much either. The principal =
asked Cynthia - not me - if everything was ok, as though Cynthia was in =
charge, or in need of help. Oddly, Cynthia told her that it=92s ok, so =
she backed off. She did not check with me to see if everything was ok. =
(She has clearly chosen a side.) When I asked her if she called Cynthia, =
she awkwardly told me that she did. She told me that she did not call to =
ask Cynthia=92s permission, but only to advise her. After a long pause =
she offered to do the same for me. I said I don=92t know if that=92s =
appropriate legally, and I don=92t need her to tell me if Cynthia is =
picking Charlotte up. It just seems totally inappropriate to me, =
especially after she asked me not to put the school in the middle of =
this, and after I told her that she does not need to call Cynthia.

Cynthia told me that she will pick the girls up at 6 pm, and then she =
walked across the street with us to Alice=92s caregiver (Laura). She had =
a few words with Laura, again, like she=92s got more rights than I do, =
and like Laura knows =91the story.=92 She told Laura that it=92s ok that =
Alice is going with me - in other words, she gave Laura permission. When =
we drove off, she followed us back to the house, and parked out front. =
She was parked there for at least an hour. She left sometime after 5:00 =
pm, and returned close to 6:00 pm with someone else in the car (I think =
it was her step-father, Dennis, who helped take stuff the day they were =
taken, and lied to me about them returning).

Then she sent all those texts pretending she didn=92t get your letter. =
She rang the doorbell once, and then left. I=92m so sick of her stories =
- no parent would ever do that if they honestly believed their kids were =
at risk of harm, let alone sexual assault.

She just texted me to let me know it=92s popcorn day at Charlotte=92s =
school, so I need to send a twoonie with her tomorrow. I have no plans =
to respond to her, unless you suggest otherwise. (Should I at least tell =
her to send all communications to my lawyer. I don=92t want her to be =
able to say that I ignored her).

She has gone so overboard with this. I might get a relatively peaceful =
weekend - but she isn=92t done yet.

Darryl
