Hi Cynthia,

I worry that you aren't aware of how Charlotte feels that you are
preventing me from seeing her for her birthday and to give her the birthday
presents I bought for her, and it makes me very uncomfortable. It would be
great if we could start to communicate again, and one way to start would be
to plan for the girls to visit and receive their presents. It would be
great if we could agree on some way to start communicating again, and to
take their feelings into consideration first and foremost.

I know you love the girls as much as I do, and care about their feelings
and thoughts.

On another note, I will send some of the money for the dentist today, and
await a corrected bill to submit to Sunlife for Ali's glasses.

Darryl
