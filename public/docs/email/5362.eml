This is an article from BC about generalized anxiety disorder, GAD. Do =
you think any of it describes Ben?


What does "Worry" Look Like?

Worry involves thoughts about negative events that might happen in the =
future, and usually begins as a "what if" question:

What if I fail my exam? I might have to repeat my grade; all of my =
friends will make fun of me; I'll have to get new friends. I might not =
get into university because I repeated a school year; I'll be a failure!
What if I make a mistake on my homework? The teacher might be upset and =
tell me I did a bad job. What if she talks about my mistake in class? =
What if the other kids laugh at me?

What is "Excessive and Uncontrollable" Worry?

Obviously, everybody worries from time to time. This is normal. Worry =
becomes a problem when it is "excessive" and "uncontrollable". That is, =
your child might have GAD if he or she is worryingmore than others =
would, and if he or she cannot stop worrying once it has started. The =
following questions can help to determine whether worry has become a =
problem:

Is my child worrying more than most children the same age?
Does my child worry even when everything is OK? (for example, worrying =
about mom and dad getting sick when everyone is healthy)
=20

What are the Worries About?

For the most part, children and teens with GAD worry about the same =
things that their peers worry about - they just worry more and more =
often. Some common GAD worries include:

Worries about health
"What if I catch cold and get sick?"
"What if my mom gets cancer?"
=20
Worries about school
"What if I failed my test?"
"What if I forget what I'm supposed to say during my presentation =
today?"
"What if I don't get into university after high school?"
=20
Worries about personal harm
"What if a bad man breaks into the house and hurts everyone?
"What if I get kidnapped when I leave school?"
=20
Worries about disasters
"What if there was an earthquake and the house got destroyed?
"What if the ozone layer keeps getting thinner?"
=20
Worries about minor matters
"What if my pants don't match with my shoes?"
"What if my book is past due at the library and I'm not allowed to =
borrow any more books?"

Physical Symptoms of GAD

Because of their worries, children and teens with GAD can experience =
many of the physical symptoms associated with anxiety, such as:

fidgety, restlessness, unable to sit still
irritable; getting easily upset, snapping at people, having frequent =
temper tantrums
sleep problems: your child might either have difficulty falling asleep =
or staying asleep (child might wake up several times every night)
difficulty paying attention or concentrating
muscle pains (often in the neck and shoulders)
headaches, stomach aches

How Else can I Determine if my Child might have GAD?

Another way to recognize GAD in your child is to consider how long your =
child has been anxious and worrying excessively:

It is normal for children to have times in their lives when they worry, =
especially when there has been a major change or stressor, such as =
moving, changing schools, the death of a loved one, or parental divorce.
For a child to have GAD, he or she needs to be worrying excessively =
almost every day for at least 6 months.

Tip For Parents:
Before deciding there is a problem, consider the stressors in your =
child's life. Is he or she having a normal reaction to a difficult =
situation, or is your child worrying even when nothing is really wrong? =
The answers to these questions can help you ascertain whether your child =
might be suffering from GAD.

Behaviours of Children and Teens with GAD

They are often described as "little adults", since they sometimes spend =
hours worrying about adult concerns (for example, the family budget, or =
whether grandma is taking her medication).

They are very perfectionistic, and, at the same time, they are also very =
unsure of themselves. They will redo activities to make sure they are =
perfect. For example, they might rewrite their homework assignments if =
there is even a tiny error or if they crossed out something on the page.


They try to relieve their worry by doing some of the following =
behaviors:

Seeking excessive reassurance (e.g., asking a parent to review homework =
several times, to make sure that it is perfect).
Checking (e.g., calling parents' cell phone several times, to ensure =
they are okay).
Information-seeking or list-making (e.g., reading every book on a =
subject before completing homework or making a decision).
Withdrawal from groups (e.g., in an attempt to avoid worrying about =
their friends, a child with GAD might just avoid having close friends; =
"what if my friend got angry with me?")
Avoidance/procrastination (avoid going to school because of worries =
about parents being harmed while they are away; procrastinating homework =
so that they don't have a lot of time to worry about whether it was well =
done)
=20

Does GAD look Different in Young Children vs. Teens?

GAD in young children:

Worries tend to be about more concrete concerns ("What if I get an =
answer wrong on my test at school?" or "What if my mom and dad get into =
a car accident?")
They mostly complain about physical symptoms instead of worries: sore =
muscles, sleep problems, stomach or head aches
=20
Helpful Tip:
You are the best source of information regarding these feelings in your =
child. Younger children will usually not tell other people (other than =
mom and dad) about these feelings.

GAD in older children and teens:

As children get older, their thinking becomes more complex, so their =
worries might become more abstract or further into the future ("what if =
global warming affects my family when I grow up and have children?")
Older children are more likely to complain about all their worries =
instead of only the physical symptoms
