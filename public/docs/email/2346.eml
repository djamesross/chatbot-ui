The events of the last few days have been hard on all of us , as we struggl=
e to do what is right for you.   To you, it may look like the rest of the f=
amily is working against you, and have little sympathy for your concerns.=20

Here is an unedited email chain from Angie and Kevin that reveals where our=
  hearts are.  Hopefully you can find some reassurance in it.=20

I totally agree. That has been my assessment regarding treatment from the o=
nset. And interesting that it comes from the source. Good call Angie =E2=80=
=93 glad you were able to reach out. Although everyone knows that a friend =
of a friend really means you. So now CAS will come knocking on our door. ;)=
 hahaha

I think C would have a pretty hard time claiming that D is unstable=E2=80=
=A6 especially when they pull out the trump card =E2=80=93 that C has been =
using D=E2=80=99s benefits to get anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, =
herself.

I think D=E2=80=99s narrative is far better than anything C can concoct.=20

Guy gets a divorce from a crazy ex-wife. She makes unfounded and irreparabl=
e accusations against this guy. Ones so hurtful that this guy is unable to =
psychologically get past them. She=E2=80=99s so controlling and manipulativ=
e over the next year that it drives this guy to =E2=80=9Cescape=E2=80=9D. T=
his coping mechanism gets the better of him. He has a wake-up call one day =
w/ the help of a terrific support network. He recognizes his mental health =
and addiction issues. He decides to quit drinking, seek treatment for his a=
ddictions and get help for his mental state. And this guy eventually gets b=
etter for the sake of his girls.

Meanwhile, the crazy ex-wife has withheld his children for no reason. She=
=E2=80=99s make several false and unfounded claims to police, CHEO, and CAS=
. She=E2=80=99s harassing his family. She=E2=80=99s lying to everyone about=
 her mental state. She=E2=80=99s lied to the courts about her separation ag=
reement. She spirals out of control anytime this guy makes a reasonable req=
uest under his legal rights. She even allows her 14 yr old son to sleep in =
the same bed with her 5 yr old daughter.=20

Which one would you give custody to?

I reached out to a friend who works with CAS, as a question about a friend =
of a friend. To be safe!

She said:

"CAS would only take custody of a child if there was a concern for their we=
ll being. If someone called CAS and make a welfare complaint against the pa=
rent, they could start a formal investigation, but unless there is a concer=
n for the safety or mistreatment, they would not take he kids. Seeking help=
 would, I suppose, identify an addition issue, but if the parent is identif=
ying it themselves and seeking the help I think it would look good for them=
.=20

If custody ever became an issue in family court, someone who is actively se=
eking to between themselves (as a parent and person) would look good on the=
m. Many lawyers for our clients recommend they be proactive and take substa=
nce abuse programs, parenting programs, etc so show the court that they are=
 putting in the work and are committed to being good parents.=20

If it is a custody dispute between two parents that would be different than=
 CAS taking the child. The other patent could argue that they can offer a m=
ore stable home for the child, but if they also prove the additional issues=
 than again seeking the treatment would look more favourable in court."
