I just has a thought about the timeline after reading my sister=E2=80=99s =
text -=20
- Oct 2 Cynthia texts my sister saying she=E2=80=99s worried about me - =
i=E2=80=99m sad because all of this stuff about our relationship is =
coming up, and she=E2=80=99s going to suggest I take some sick leave=20
- I take sick leave mid-october
- a few days later Cyn tells me she is taking sick leave too, and that =
she=E2=80=99s now depressed
- then she takes the kids and goes back to work, and calls CAS saying =
that she=E2=80=99s concerned about my mental state, and including in her =
affidavit that my mental state is a concern, and that I=E2=80=99ve taken =
sick leave
