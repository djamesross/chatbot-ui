 many ways to reach us.</div><div><br></div><div>The matter of what constitu=

harlotte was cancelled, remains to be addressed. I spoke to both of them. Al=
ice was dressed, lying on your bed watching a video. Charlotte was energetic=
 and told me about what she did during the day, including how Alice took par=
t in activities but had to lie down in between, and that the plan was to go f=
or a walk so Alice can get some fresh air, and then watch a movie. These are=
 things that are part of parenting time. The bar for cancelling court ordere=
