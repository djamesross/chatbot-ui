Without Prejudice,

Given the short notice and that it is end of term I can't meet before 4:00
pm, at the earliest. Teaching, not unlike the law, is not a 9-5 job, and I
have an exam to complete for tomorrow.

I would first like to know how Alice is, and whether she is well enough for
a visit. If not, a makeup visit will have to be arranged.

Cynthia, I responded to your lawyer. You have been unclear and waivered on
who I should communicate with, at times firmly stating I speak only to her,
and at others showing no regard. I think this will be better for all
involved, in particular given you are insistent on moving ahead with the
motion without cooperation.

If you would like to meet a little earlier, 3:30 may be possible, then it
will have to be at the college. Otherwise the closest place is
Centerpointe.
