I just spoke to CAS and there is no record yet, but I will be pursuing this
as quickly as possible. It is clear you are trying to alienate me from the
girls and as are not willing to work cooperatively, so I will be moving
forward as quickly as I can. This hurts the girls and has continued far too
long.

They do not deserve this. However, I feel far less anxious now it is clear
what you have been working toward.
