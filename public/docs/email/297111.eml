Any,

This just came back to me - last year, around Christmas, Cynthia dropped =
the boys off at their=92s dad=92s house. Their dad=92s partner is Tracy, =
and her parents were staying at the house. They have really taken to the =
boys, and try to have a lot of fun with the boys, and spoil them - all =
good things for grandparents, as far as I could tell. But after Cynthia =
dropped them off she started to panic - this is what she told me at the =
time - because she believed that Tracy=92s father might be molesting =
Sam. She said that when Sam came in the house, Tracy=92s father picked =
him up and tickled him, and she thought Sam looked uncomfortable. =46rom =
that, and her own issues, she was scared that he was being molested. I=92m=
 trying to find emails or texts that mention the incident. Honestly, for =
several days to a week she was totally preoccupied about this, and =
talked about going back to get him. She eventually just dropped the =
issue.

The only mention I can find so far is from an email I sent to her on =
February 5, of this year:=20

Sam was upset last night. Really upset. We talked about the problem, and =
he felt better. But I was worried that there was something bigger going =
on =96 something that had happened to him. I pointed out that he=92s had =
lots of hard feelings lately, and asked him if there are any really big =
problems he=92s had, something that a person has done to him. Your =
concerns about Tracy=92s dad had come to mind, and I was worried =
something had happened that might explain why he=92s so upset about so =
many things.

She told me about it, I=92m pretty sure we brought it up with Dr. James =
because we saw her shortly after the incident, and I=92m sure she talked =
about it with her old therapist. (Can we request her old therapist=92s =
notes? Or at least that she answer questions about that particular =
incident?)

And just a note about Dr. James - she is not good at getting back to =
people, or meeting deadlines. We should probably send the questions as =
soon as we can, if we want answers by Thursday.

And I know this is going to sound crazy, but at this point I have to =
bring it up, and my sister has really been pushing me to raise this =
issue. Charlotte and Alice are frequently not feeling well - not bad =
enough to go to the doctor=92s, but fussy. Charlotte frequently =
complains about a sore tummy, and often has loose/discoloured bowel =
movements. She also frequently says that she=92s tired. She=92s four, =
and she often says =91uhhh, I=92m tiiiired.=92 That=92s not normal. =
Yesterday Charlotte did both - she said she was tired, and she had a =
loose bowel movement. I asked her how her tummy=92s been, and she told =
me that it=92s been sore, but that 'mommy gave her medicine to make it =
feel better, the same medicine she gives Ali because she cries so much.' =
I kept meaning to get her into the doctor=92s, but it would come and go, =
and never get much worse than a sore tummy and feeling tired. My =
sister=92s partner, Kevin, who does have a P.hD. in psychology, said =
that there are cases where mothers will make their own children sick - =
it=92s a documented form of child abuse.=20

This is really hard for me to think much about, and I think that the =
girls are probably fussy and upset because of all the stress and =
dysfunction. And maybe she's giving them too much ibuprofen, too =
frequently, which can cause stomach bleeding and diarrhea. But at this =
point, I can=92t put anything past her.

At what point can I do something out of concern for the health and =
safety of my girls? Even if she=92s not poisoning them, this sexual =
abuse hysteria is out of control.

Again, I know I seem like a crazy-worried parent, and i know it=92s the =
weekend and you just want to be a parent, so I=92m sorry about all of =
the emails!
