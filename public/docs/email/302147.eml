Hi Todd,

It was great having you guys over on Sunday - we should do that more =
often!

I=E2=80=99m trying to get my financial situation sorted out as best I =
can, for now. I won=E2=80=99t know how much debt I=E2=80=99ll have until =
the house is sold, but Cynthia and I have agreed try selling privately, =
which could save 10-15k, and maybe even get us close to zero net loss.=20=


I did agree to give her the van, in exchange for half the value of it =
(it was part of a bigger negotiation). Because I have a decent salary, =
my monthly costs are ok - it=E2=80=99s the overall debt I=E2=80=99m =
carrying that I want to try to reduce. So I figured if I use the money =
she gives me to pay down debt (credit card or line of credit), and get a =
lease or finance a car at 0.49-0.99% interest, I=E2=80=99ll be doing =
better. I=E2=80=99m still not sure if I should finance or lease though. =
For now, I need to keep the payments down, so leasing seems to make =
sense. Any thoughts?

That said, I don=E2=80=99t know if I=E2=80=99ll be able to get a lease =
on my own, given my current situation. If that=E2=80=99s the case, would =
you guys be willing to c0-sign?=20
