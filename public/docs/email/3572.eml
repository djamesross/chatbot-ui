Hi Cynthia,

I just spoke to Ottawa Police. They are aware that there is a police =
enforcement clause in the court decision and will be meeting me at your =
address shortly after 1 pm to return Alice to my care if she has not =
been dropped off as scheduled.

I sincerely hope that this is not necessary and ask again for you to =
drop her off.=20

Darryl
