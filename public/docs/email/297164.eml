I spoke to family therapist. She didn=92t jump to my defence by any =
means, and wants to take time to hear from Cynthia too. But I=92m =
confident that her observations and notes will not show in anyway that I =
was a threat, or scary, or whatever else Cynthia has been saying.

One things she did say, is that it=92s very concerning from a mental =
health view that you were recording. She said it can be seen as =
controlling or even paranoid. She said she thinks she understands why I =
did it (because my wife was lying constantly - but in nicer terms), but =
is very concerned about it, and encouraged me to stop, and to erase all =
of the recordings I made. Is this a cause for concern in my case?

She said that in order to speak to you she would need a consent form =
signed from both of us.

Her name is Dr. Emilie James, 613-799-3850, dr.emiliejames@gmail.com=20
