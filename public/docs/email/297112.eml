Thanks Any,

I=92ll take it a day at a time.

I would like to send that email to Cynthia, denying her allegations. I =
don=92t like leaving it unsaid. I would also like to send it to her =
parents and sister, who have all helped her, and who I was close to. I =
want them to know that I deny it, and I=92m not afraid to confront the =
allegations. I think that if they start to doubt her, they might put =
more pressure on her.

Are there any downsides to sending the email to her, her mom and dad, =
and her sister?

(I=92ve pasted it below again)

Thanks,

Darryl

Cynthia,

I have to address your accusations. I was shocked and sickened to find =
out that you are accusing me of molesting Charlotte. To be called a =
pedophile, and an incestuous pedophile, by my own wife, is =
heartbreaking. There has been a lot of hard feelings between us these =
past few months, but there are still years in our past of good times, of =
love, of friendship, and of caring. So to be accused of such horrible =
acts truly hurts. To have to even imagine them, is truly sickening.

I don=92t know which is harder for me to accept - that you believe these =
allegations, or that you have made them up. But one of these is true, =
because they are false. I have never molested or inappropriately touched =
either of our daughters.=20

I have been working as hard as I can to show that these allegations are =
false. I have been chasing whatever leads come up, as they come up. When =
I found out that you made a police report I immediately went to the =
station to request a copy. When I found out that you called CAS I =
contacted Heather and immediately made an appointment. When I found out =
that you took Charlotte to CHEO for a physical exam, I was there, =
reading the report, two hours later. I found the nurse that admitted =
Charlotte, and she helped me to understand the chart, and your =
accusations. I=92m chasing down every lead I can because I know that =
there is no evidence, no proof, and no reason to believe that I would =
hurt my children.

These are truly horrible allegations. Monstrous, even. And they hurt me. =
But what I=92m more worried about is how they will affect Charlotte and =
Alice. What if one of them hears about these rumours - through a family =
member, someone in the community, or some other way? What if, when they =
are teenagers, someone says =91hey, isn=92t that the girl who=92s father =
molested her?=92 Rumours like this do not need truth to hurt, and would =
do terrible damage to a teenage girl - or a girl of any age. If anyone =
believes even part of this story, it could mean no playdates at my =
house, it could create tension at school, it could hurt our girls, and =
it could affect my career. The damage that false rumours like this can =
do cannot be calculated neatly. Nevertheless, damages can be found and =
levelled.

I am truly sorry that our marriage is ending. There was a lot of good in =
it, and it brought me happiness. But while our marriage is ending, our =
relationship together is not. It=92s not ending, but it is changing. Our =
relationship will continue as the parents of Charlotte and Alice. And =
that relationship needs to work, for the sake of Alice and Charlotte, =
and Ben and Sam.

We should be working on our new relationship right now, so that we can =
support our children. But I cannot let these allegations stand. I have =
to do everything that I can do, to make sure that they are proven false. =
When allegations this important, this horrible, are raised, they must be =
dealt with.
