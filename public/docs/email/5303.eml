Hi,

I=E2=80=99d like to take Alice and Charlotte out for an evening this =
week, for Char=E2=80=99s birthday, to have dinner and dessert. I don=E2=80=
=99t want it to involve any disagreements between us. Just to celebrate =
her, by picking her up and dropping her off, with Ali and my mom, and =
that=E2=80=99s all. To make it normal, and to celebrate, tomorrow would =
be great, but if not possible how about Thursday? We can pick them up =
from the bus, and have them back at, or within a few minutes of, 7:30.
