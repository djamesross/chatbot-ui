Again, thank you for your responses. Cynthia didn=E2=80=99t budge from my em=
ail, so I didn=E2=80=99t get visitation. =20

I received an email from a family member making strong but baseless claims, b=
ut six were included. It tells me to get treatment and deal with things. Thi=
s is all hearsay and incorrect.=20

But I feel lost and just need a bit of grounding in what matters and what do=
esn=E2=80=99t.=20

our mother informed me she was taking the girls she said that she would go a=
head to the car and leave me get the girls ready and bring them over the hil=
l to the car.
> September 17, Kilbernie Park: I walked my daughter over the hill and out o=
f sight and without an escort to the washroom. My other daughter followed us=
. We chased a cricket into the field, also out of sight of your mother for n=
o less than 30 minutes. Once again your mother went ahead to the car, out of=
 sight, leaving me to bring the girls to her car.
> September 21, Greenbank Park: I arrived at the park and the girls ran to h=
ug me. Your stepfather remained in the distance on a bench for approximately=
 30 minutes at which point the girls asked where he went. We realized that h=
e went to his car, which was not visible from where we were much of the time=
. He remained there for approximately 1 hour.
