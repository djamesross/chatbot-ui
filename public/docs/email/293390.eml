Ms. Boyce,

Your client is once again displaying clear patterns of behavior. This will
be particularly clear if, just prior to court, she has a change of hear and
decides a generous agreement is best. She did that last time while
maintaining accusations that I molested Charlotte, as you will recall.

I also note that you have to date not replied to me letter and it appears
that the strategy is to ignore me, and therefore cause harm to my daughters.

I had plans with my daughters to see a movie this evening which your client
was aware of and offered no disagreement. But because her mother claims her
feelings were hurt your client refused to allow the girls to see the movie
wth me, which we had long planned for and I prep-paid for tickets I have
requested and expect reimbursement for that cost, s well as an evening this
week when I can take them..

As you are aware the claim her mother made does not justify her reactions
and is clearly a punitive action directed at me but which hurt Charlotte
the most. I was told she was feeling sick when I saw her this evening.
However, once comfortable she he told me she was not sick, but upset that
our plans had been cancelled and she was given no explanation.

In breech of the temporary court orders, Cynthia's step father was made
supervisor. I approached him respectfully and indicated that your client's
fear has been that I will abduct the girls, and that the movie theater has
fewer entrances and is more constrained than Indigo. I then asked if he or
or your client would call the police if brought the girls to the movie as
agreed. He indicated they would. I don't believe the police would have
agreed to become involved, especially given the last incident, but I will
not risk exposing my daughters to what was a scary experience for them the
last time it happened, and was deemed unnecessary by the police. And by all
means collect and include their notes in your response. Your client would
do so without regard for my daughters feelings, but nor will she or is she
capable of providing an explanation to our daughters.

Knowing your client as I do, and her triggers, it's safe to assume you more
than likely had to talk her out of proceeding with court when she first
took the children away wihthout explanation and with premeditation. That
cost me more than $12,000, so I will provide no suggestion that you do
anything other than accept the motion, where I will be seeking  an
immediate return to shared custody, child support, and court costs. I may
also pursue damages based on malicious intent that has caused financial
hardship.

In the meantime i kindly request you no longer delay your response to my
previous email before you leave the country. Your client has repeated that
she has discussed this with you since August, and while the reasons have
change quite dramatically, that merely undermines her repeated claims that
you had come to a conclusion and would be shari it with me shortly.I
needn't remind you that you are not putting me off, and that this case is
not about me, and it will be incumbent on your client to explain her
disregard for our daughters best interests, continued requests, and
well-being.

You are well aware of your client's history of accusation, the fact that
her affidavit includes knowingly false statements, and that this case is
about the girls.

I will send updated financial information tomorrow when I am on campus and
can access it; you received my treatment plan and have failed to explain
what further information you claim to require, and your request for further
details about my care accident that occurred long ago is nothing more than
a scare tactic.

Your client''s near complete refusal to allow me to have a relationship
with my daughters that is not subject to her direct control is your job to
prove. This position cannot be maintainted and it is merely a matter of how
many false accusations she can come up with. In the meantime she is
demonstrating disregard for the girls and demonstrably causing them undue
stress, hardship, anxiety and  has demonstrated through her actions and
choices that she is interfering with their right to have a meaningful
relationship with thier father, and acted in bad faith the entire time she
claimed to act cooperatively and with CAS.

Personally I give you the benefit of doubt given that I have experienced
and documented her episodes and deceit. But given what you have written in
your letters to me you have either failed to ensure a modicum of veracity
or are simply taking her at her word. Eitehr way, I trust you agree that
the temporary orders are mo longer applicable, your client is in breech of
the orders by maintaining strict control and allowing me no imput, and
shows little concern for oir daughters but a strong interest in control.

The motion will be submitted next week and I look forward to the reading
the response;

Best,
Darryl
