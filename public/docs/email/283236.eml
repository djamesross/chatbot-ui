Hi there,

Charlotte is home sick today. She is running a fever and very stuffed up.

The girls passport applications were denied and I am required to produced
birth certificates with parents l names . This request takes at least 15
business days and is only processed through Toronto office.

There is a chance we will not have them in time and I may have to postpone
our trip. We are all feeling anxious about it.

Alice has expressed that she would like to speak to a therapist, someone
she can trust. She wants a girl and to meet virtually.

She is also struggling in her studies and having a hard time focusing. Her
she has noticed this and so has her teacher Ashlee and myself.

I am looking into getting her some help and possibly tested. A big factor
will be the cost as I am the only one with benefits and cannot cover much
of the difference.

There is a great practice in Hamilton that has treated Kelly=E2=80=99s fami=
ly and
Ben and Sam. Who are reasonably priced. This would be for individual
counselling. I=E2=80=99m going to send info to you.

If you have some suggestions please send them over.
