Thanks for getting back to me, and giving me an update. I just read the
email about about returning to school Monday, which is good news.

As for today, do they have extracurricular activities? Are they available
earlier? At 3, or 3:30? I=E2=80=99m not available after, because of the MRI=
 and
travel - it will be too late. This absolute restriction is extraordinary
and unwarranted. I=E2=80=99m being denied complete access, and extremely li=
mited
FaceTime.

I=E2=80=99m available Friday too and would love to see the girls. Until we =
sort out
the matter of medical records, I don=E2=80=99t even care if you want to sup=
ervise,
I just want to see them, and they need to see me too.

Darryl
