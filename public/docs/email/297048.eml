Hi Any,

Its bad news - we paid it off after we were married. The thought of =
having to pay Cynthia money at the end of this makes me feel sick to my =
stomach. But more importantly, what happens if I simply don=E2=80=99t =
have the money? I will be applying for a line of credit to cover the =
debt from the house, and my legal fees. I will have to have a co-signer =
to get that line of credit, which I have. But if I owe Cynthia 5 or 10k, =
I don=E2=80=99t think I will be able to borrow any more money - even =
with a co-signer.=20

Ugh.

Darryl

ps: I hope you didn=E2=80=99t get stuck!
