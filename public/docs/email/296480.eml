Hi Alison, I had trouble contacting you because I was not made aware you mov=
ed law firms.=20

This is a time sensitive matter, and my primary goal right now is not to all=
ow this drama in front of the girls, and I will certainly try to avoid it. I=
 am sure you understand.=20

If you could forward the court order referred to, I will look at it. I=E2=80=
=99ve made it clear many times to Cynthia that I won=E2=80=99t take the girl=
s, I will follow agreements, and act in good faith. So any police interventi=
on, which is certainly the most extreme step, is not in the interest of the g=
irls, and easily be avoided. In fact this should have been communicated to m=
e much earlier. She knows I am at the beach, sent her sister to confirm, and=
 waited until 4 pm to communicate with me. Right now the the girls are in th=
e water so if in fact the court order is made available and is applicable th=
en I will bring them back but it won=E2=80=99t be by five because it will ta=
ke us a little bit longer to get back. I=E2=80=99m guessing 6 - 630. I assum=
e that that=E2=80=99s acceptable and worth avoiding the drama that would ens=
ue otherwise
