I know the past was hard, but this is the present and I am healthy and I met=
 your condition, which was to meet Krystle. There is no need to have a talk w=
ith the girls first.  Krystle recommended that I talk to the girls about my i=
llness. She said that it would be more meaningful coming from me because I w=
as the one that was sick. So we came up with a way of explaining my illness t=
o the girls that is simple enough and true enough, so that they can understa=
nd. I=E2=80=99m sure you can see why its better coming from me.=20

My mom can=E2=80=99t come tomorrow, and it would be unfortunate for the girl=
s to have to wait again to see me.=20
