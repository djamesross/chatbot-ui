Individuals with ADHD function best in a consistent, structured, =
predictable environment where rules, goals, expectations, consequences =
and incentives are visibly posted in a prominent location for all =
involved to follow routinely. These should be simple, clear, and few in =
number. Immediate consequences and positive reinforcement are best, and =
close monitoring of successes and failures is essential to ensure a =
positive outcome.=20

Behaviour Management

Identify goals and target behaviours to change: There are many symptoms =
within ADHD but the behavioural task is to pick specific symptoms (no =
more than one or two at a time) to work on. Goals must be tailored to =
meet the individual=92s needs and be appropriate for different ages and =
stages of development. Goals may change over time as circumstances =
change.

Examples include:

preschooler with temper tantrums =96 respond positively to desired =
behaviour and use ignoring and good time out techniques to respond to =
unwanted behaviour (e.g. 1-2-3 technique)

school age =96 use lists and agendas150, teacher reminders, use positive =
incentives

adult =96 keep items like cell phones and keys in a designated, visible =
location. Post lists as reminders to check for necessary items each =
morning before leaving home.

Structure the day and the environment: Once habits are reinforced =
consistently, they may become automatic. Promote routine, consistency =
and follow-through as much as possible, especially for morning =
activities, after school/work and bedtime. Post rules/checklists, which =
should be clear, few in number and placed in obvious locations (fridge, =
bedroom, office etc.). Use sheet protectors and dry-erase markers so =
that the lists can be checked off and reused. Habits take a little =
longer to develop in ADHD patients so incentive strategies are often =
necessary.

Help select positive incentives to promote desired behaviours:

These incentives must be appropriate for age, developmental stage and =
economic ability. They must fit with the family=92s beliefs/cultural =
systems. They should include activities the individual can do and items =
that they can earn (e.g. stickers, toys for younger children, tokens, =
video games, TV, favorite meals, etc.)47, 193, 194. For younger =
children, the rewards should ideally be frequent, small, tangible and =
immediate. For older patients, natural consequences can be highly =
motivating (e.g. keys to the car for the adolescent, allowances, better =
curfew times, special outings etc.).

These incentives need to be changed often to keep their interest as =
individuals with ADHD have a need for novelty. Variable reinforcements =
can be even more powerful (e.g. =93When you do..., then you can choose =
from the mystery prize box=94).

Use positive incentives while avoiding negative threats e.g. =93When you =
do...then you will receive...=94 (something positive). This promotes a =
natural work ethic that also enhances self-esteem and pride in =
achievement. Impulsive behaviour is often a lifelong theme. Children =
with ADHD can be demanding and they need to know that they can earn =
their desired reward by working for it. Work first, fun later! One needs =
to use similar techniques with the adult with ADHD who may still lack =
frustration-tolerance and patience to wait for rewards.=20



Parent training181, 182, 195: Children with ADHD can be challenging and =
may irritate authority figures. Research shows that they can be =
stressful for parents196. They draw negative attention to themselves. =
Positive parenting approaches and maintenance of generational boundaries =
are essential. Information for parents is available online in the parent =
section of the CADDRA website (www.caddra.ca) and on the CADDAC website =
(www.caddac.ca). Parents should also be directed to local mental health =
agencies which often have parenting programs.=
