Hi there,

We can do weekend visit on Saturday from 11-1 would be ideal. Please let me
know. It would be helpful for Todd to do some of the driving.

As for expenses, I realize all these factors and I'm still asking you to
start contributing a minimal amount. Even $100 bi-weekly would help.


Yes you are welcome to visit with Ben, I do agree it would be better to
start that down the road.


Take care,

Cynthia
