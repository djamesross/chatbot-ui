Hi Cynthia,

The following refers to your email below. I have listed the following =
issues point by point to try to be as clear as possible. I hope this =
will help address them and reduce further issues, and for future =
reference.

1. You did not address the fact that you not only took Alice home =
despite an agreement and my parenting time, but you refused to let her =
FaceTime me and simply ignored my text message. Kindly respond to my =
texts or emails promptly in situations like this.

2. You did not explain why you did not inform me earlier about the =
appointment. You state below that you knew she needed an appointment as =
early as Monday, and that the appointment would likely be Tuesday. =
Clearly you were aware of the situation at least the day before, knew =
when you had to call the clinic, and chose not to inform me until after =
the fact. Keeping me up to date will avoid this in the future.

3. Justice Smoji was not able to bring herself to accept the many and =
varied allegations made, and it is clear that those allegations =
misrepresented past issues or were untrue. Chasing not to communicate =
with me prior to making the appointment is suspect and I can=E2=80=99t =
assume any explanation that you provide is factual, especially when it =
is after the fact and follows a pattern of interference. Communicating =
with me before making decisions will avoid this issue.

4. To date, with the exception of Kenzie=E2=80=99s birthday party this =
past Sunday, every single missed or changed time has been because you =
decided to change or cancel them without attempting to communicate with =
me. Each time taken together makes reveals a pattern of interference and =
shows a disregard for the Judge=E2=80=99s ruling. I appreciate the way =
you communicated with me about the birthday party and hope that this =
will continue going forward.

5. Alice has talked to me about her difficulty having a bowel movement =
and I have spoken to Dr, Brenhouse about it. She has tried here, and I =
am fully capable of supporting her when she passes a difficult stool. I =
think that clarifying what parenting time means and includes would help =
going forward.

6. In an attempt to avoid situations like this I raised the issue of =
what to do when one or both of them have an illness, injury, etc. To =
date you have refused to address the issue, and ignored my request to =
clarify the matter to reduce and avoid conflict and issues like =
yesterday. I hope that this is an issue that we can address without the =
need for lawyers or motions.

7. You state below that, "to date, if a time is missed, we have managed =
to make up the time on alternative dates." That=E2=80=99s not accurate =
because it ignores the fact that you cancelled or changed my parenting =
time for your own reasons in every single case except one. Ongoing =
interference hinders and undermines successful parenting time for =
Charlotte and Alice. While it might be intended to undermine my =
parenting time, this behavior unequivocally harms our daughters. It =
directly works against their best interests. It is not acceptable to =
interfere with or obstruct my parenting time because we 'manage to make =
up the time on alternative dates.'  I think that accepting that changes =
to parenting time can only be made by prior agreement or emergency, as =
defined following point 6., will reduce a lot of conflict and =
unnecessary communication.

8. Your email Tuesday morning stated that Alice would be picked up at =
5:30 pm and dropped off afterwards. I agreed. You broke this agreement. =
The reason you give, that temporary discomfort and a painful bowel =
movement are grounds to deny parenting time as well as FaceTime contact =
is, well, poop.=20

The facts are: I agreed that you could take Alice to the appointment on =
condition that she would be dropped off afterwards. Yesterday you broke =
that agreement. This has been occurring for several years and includes =
extreme periods of unlawfully withholding the children that lasted more =
than 12 months. Clearly I cannot trust you will return the girls or that =
you will cooperate with court orders or agreements. If this continues or =
happens ever again I will have to take further legal action or rely on =
police enforcement to ensure that you do not once again deny contact or =
unlawfully withhold them whether next week, next month, or next year.=20

Spending money on further motions and a trial is not the best use of =
money that should benefit our daughters. Having to use police =
enforcement is also a least desirable way to solve issues. The motion =
did lead to some good outcomes, in particular we now have clearer =
boundaries than before and I hope that following it will help us move =
forward in a way that supports Charlotte and Alice.
