Hi Jane,

Here is a draft response to Ms. Holmes regarding Sunday visit. Please =
let me know if you have suggestions about wording.

And I just realized that we didn=E2=80=99t sig n a retainer and I =
didn=E2=80=99t pay you! Can I send it do you by email transfer? If so, I =
can send it to you immediately. If not I can return tomorrow to sign & =
pay. I agree a  should be sent as soon as possible.=20

Without Prejudice,

I will accept the offer for limited supervised visitation this Sunday =
because it is the only that I can see my daughters right now. I do not =
agree with supervision to my parenting time with my children so I am =
accepting it on a without prejudice.
