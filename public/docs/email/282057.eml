Ok, that sounds like a plan. They are with Dawn tomorrow and then I am off
next week, so it might be as a supervisor or I can see if Dawn is free. I
am trying to make plans for next week so the sooner I know the better as  I
like to be out with the kids by water as much as possible. They are with
Dawn the final week of July/August.

I would like that too and will try on my part.

Cynthia
