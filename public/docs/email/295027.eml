received any explanation or justification for this severe restriction in =
access to our daughters.=20

Please have them call me tonight before they go to bed. Even if only for =
a quick goodnight.

Also, please let me know a time they can talk tomorrow, ideally during =
the day.=20

Thanks,
Darryl
