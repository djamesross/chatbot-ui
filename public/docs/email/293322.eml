Hi Darryl,

This Friday would work as a make up day for both the missed camp visits
days as it's 7 additional hours which total weekly in person visit time and=
 *I
can confirm the girls can be there from 10-5pm*. For the record, you have
had in person visits Sunday noon- 8pm and half days on Tuesdays for most of
the summer which is more than what was court ordered and have have made up
more than 7 hours a week for some time..

Next week is quite booked up with camp, soccer, dentist appointment for
Alice and open house for Charlotte's junior highschool. I will take them
out of camp on Tuesday so you can have some extra time for the last day of
the extended summer visit from noon-5:45 pm.

 To compensate for the shorter visits for Tuesday August 29, September 5,
and Tuesday September 12, I suggest  just sticking to the extended Sunday
which is eight hours a week (12-8 pm)  for the total in person
weekly visits. Again this is an hour longer than the 7 hour in person
weekly court ordered visit.

The three Tuesday nights mentioned above are temporary as we wait for their
Fall soccer season schedule and I will be in touch when we receive it.


Cynthia
