Hi Darryl,

Sorry for the awkward timing on this one. I had followed up with Alison a
few weeks back about the missed child support payments and FRO. I did not
expect for her to send you the e-mail two weeks later when you were being
discharged.

Anyways with that being said, as you can appreciate, I do want clarity on
your financial situation. Can you please answer the following questions:
-What is your current  situation with you?
-Are you currently on unpaid leave from work? If so when did that begin?
-If you are on unpaid leave , how long do you expect to be off?
- Have you applied for long term disability?
-Did you submit all the required paperwork to FRO? If so when? If not, when
can we expect you to do this?
-When can I expect some sort of child support payment from you?


Thanks in advance.

Cynthia
