How can parents help?
Children with ADHD need guidance and understanding from their parents =
and teachers to reach their full potential and to succeed in school. =
Before a child is diagnosed, frustration, blame, and anger may have =
built up within a family. Parents and children may need special help to =
overcome bad feelings. Mental health professionals can educate parents =
about ADHD and how it impacts a family. They also will help the child =
and his or her parents develop new skills, attitudes, and ways of =
relating to each other.
Parenting skills training helps parents learn how to use a system of =
rewards and consequences to change a child's behavior. Parents are =
taught to give immediate and positive feedback for behaviors they want =
to encourage, and ignore or redirect behaviors they want to discourage. =
In some cases, the use of "time-outs" may be used when the child's =
behavior gets out of control. In a time-out, the child is removed from =
the upsetting situation and sits alone for a short time to calm down.
Parents are also encouraged to share a pleasant or relaxing activity =
with the child, to notice and point out what the child does well, and to =
praise the child's strengths and abilities. They may also learn to =
structure situations in more positive ways. For example, they may =
restrict the number of playmates to one or two, so that their child does =
not become overstimulated. Or, if the child has trouble completing =
tasks, parents can help their child divide large tasks into smaller, =
more manageable steps. Also, parents may benefit from learning =
stress-management techniques to increase their own ability to deal with =
frustration, so that they can respond calmly to their child's behavior.
Sometimes, the whole family may need therapy. Therapists can help family =
members find better ways to handle disruptive behaviors and to encourage =
behavior changes. Finally, support groups help parents and families =
connect with others who have similar problems and concerns. Groups often =
meet regularly to share frustrations and successes, to exchange =
information about recommended specialists and strategies, and to talk =
with experts.
Tips to Help Kids Stay Organized and Follow Directions
Schedule. Keep the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. =
Include time for homework, outdoor play, and indoor activities. Keep the =
schedule on the refrigerator or on a bulletin board in the kitchen. =
Write changes on the schedule as far in advance as possible.
Organize everyday items. Have a place for everything, and keep =
everything in its place. This includes clothing, backpacks, and toys.
Use homework and notebook organizers. Use organizers for school material =
and supplies. Stress to your child the importance of writing down =
assignments and bringing home the necessary books.
Be clear and consistent. Children with ADHD need consistent rules they =
can understand and follow.
Give praise or rewards when rules are followed. Children with ADHD often =
receive and expect criticism. Look for good behavior, and praise it.
