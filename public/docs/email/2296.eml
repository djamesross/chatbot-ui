Basically, you're describing a pager system- just without the voice or text=
 messaging. =E2=80=8E push the button, send a pulse to the matching unit. I=
nteresting idea...

Short answer: =C2=A0no, unfortunately.
Closest thing I can think of is a gizmo called a Tile. See it at tileapps.c=
om. But it's not going to do exactly what you want..

Subject: Technical Question!

I=E2=80=99ve got a technical question for you. There are bracelets for coup=
les that are connected to phones via bluetooth, and when one partner touche=
s their=E2=80=99s, the other partner feels a pulse, vibration, or tickle. H=
ere is an example: http://postscapes.com/bluetooth-couples-bracelet-bond

I thought of this idea for parents and kids, as a way to feel connected tha=
t wouldn=E2=80=99t make the other parent feel threatened: unlike a cell pho=
ne, no messages, calls, GPS tracking, etc. - just a simple pulse or vibrati=
on once in a while, to feel connected. Do you know if it=E2=80=99s possible=
 to have a small unit that does not rely on a bluetooth tether, that can tr=
ansmit and receive? I=E2=80=99m imagining something like a two-way pager, b=
ut it would have to be relatively small and inexpensive, and send and recei=
ve via cell networks (or at least that=E2=80=99s the only way I can think o=
f - wifi would be too limited).

Do you know of anything that could work? Or might work?=20
