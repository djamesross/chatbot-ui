Hi,

I wanted to give you both a full statement about the recordings, for =
what it=E2=80=99s worth at this point.

Coming into the new school year, Ben=E2=80=99s behaviour became markedly =
worse. He was anxious, angry, and aggressive. I have always supported =
him, and in fact initiated most of the treatments that he has received. =
However, I was becoming more and more worried about the effect of his =
behaviour on the other kids (threats to hurt himself, kill himself, go =
on a killing spree). When I brought this up with Cynthia she became =
defensive. She said that the other kids are fine, that I=E2=80=99m just =
overly worried about my girls, and that I=E2=80=99m making Ben out to be =
worse than he is. It was very concerning that she couldn=E2=80=99t see =
how it would affect the other children.

So, I thought that if I recorded some interactions with the family I =
could share them with her in counselling, to help her see that the =
behaviour can be scary for the other kids. Before I did that, at a =
couple=E2=80=99s counselling session, she finally did realize and =
acknowledge that it would be scary and hard on the other kids (therapist =
could confirm this). She said she had a block and just needed to believe =
the girls would be fine, because it was too hard to face.

So that=E2=80=99s why I started recording. I didn=E2=80=99t tell her =
because she gets angry, and it would have led to a fight. But I needed =
her to see how the other kids were being affected. We need to take care =
of all four kids, and so far Ben was getting most of the attention =
because of his extreme behaviour. Cynthia was never checking to see how =
they were feeling or coping.

However, as I was reviewing some of them I started to notice =
inconsistencies with things Cynthia said. Soon after that she began to =
describe my behaviour in ways that were very different from what I =
remembered, but I had the recordings to return to. So I started because =
I was concerned for the kids, but it soon became about me and Cynthia.
