Hi Linda & Dennis,

We talked aout meeting a little later, having something to to eat (maybe =
Casey=E2=80=99s in Marketplace?) and then going to Dairy queen for a =
treat, and I can give Ali her present.

Does that work for you? We could just meet at Dairy Queen for some food =
and a treat. They sell burgers and fries, as far as I know.

I can be there by by 4:30-5:00, if that works.
