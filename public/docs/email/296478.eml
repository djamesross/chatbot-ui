This is way out of control. Any, I don't even understand how this can be =

but this is coming from my wife, my partner of six years, the mother of =
my children=E2=80=A6 I just don=E2=80=99t understand how she could be =
doing this.=20

I will let you know as soon as I hear from either the police or CAS. =
I=E2=80=99m assuming I should not bring up the recordings with them =
(please let me know either way). What if she=E2=80=99s told them about =
the recordings - should I offer to share it then, or wait and talk to =
you?
