Hi Darryl,

Let's keep the original time for Thanksgiving on Sunday. I forgot the girls
and cousins planned a race that Sunday morning, so the girls can miss the
soccer game that night.

If on that Sunday, you would like a few more hours, please let me know, I
would suggest 1-7 pm so that you could have a meal.

I followed up with Allison on the therapist and will let you know.

Cynthia
