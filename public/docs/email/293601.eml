Hi Alison,

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Before I went into hospital I=
 was not focused on this, but now that I=E2=80=99m out I am scrambling to ca=
tch up, and very much want to work this out. Unfortunately I=E2=80=99m short=
 on resources, so I have to figure this all out as I go, but I am committed t=
o negotiating, and am working on collecting the documents requested.  I have=
 an appointment tomorrow which will help, and plan to send you what I have b=
een able to collect by late Thursday/early Friday, with the rest to follow a=
s soon as possible. (Ideally I=E2=80=99ll have it by then.)

I was going to ask you how you would prefer to arrange negotiating, but Cynt=
hia asked if I was willing to meet you before the 14th. If that=E2=80=99s th=
e case, I certainly am. Would Monday work for you?

Please let me know if you need anything else,

Best

Darryl
