Hi Darryl,

My mom is picking them up from here and driving them to your place.

For me it is my time and money 9as well as my mom's),  the girls are happy
to see you and have expressed they feel safe at the moment,

Thus *if you can look for some suggestions on how *to drive the girls
safely to and from your place, I am open to considering them (ie rules
UBER, a trusted friend etc...).Currently, I can't afford to drive them more
than I do or pay for a service.
