Hi Cynthia,

You=E2=80=99re right that the 2/2/3 schedule is far better. It=E2=80=99s =
better for us, because we see them more often. But more importantly, =
it=E2=80=99s better for kids this age. I met with a family therapist =
last week (by myself), who has lots of experience with kids and =
separation. She said that kids Alice=E2=80=99s age, even Charlotte=E2=80=99=
s, start to feel a real sense of loss after only a few days. She said =
that a 7/7 schedule, even with one day in the middle, is =
=E2=80=98detrimental=E2=80=99 to the girls. Those are her words, and =
there is research to back it up. They are already experiencing =
separation anxiety, and I think we should make it easier on them.

At this point, I can=E2=80=99t force you to change the schedule. I =
pushed as hard as I could for the 2/2/3 at our meeting, but we needed to =
agree on something at the time. And the girls are stuck with it now, =
unless you agree to change it. So, I=E2=80=99m asking you if you=E2=80=99l=
l agree to move to a 2/2/3 schedule, on an interim and non-prejudice =
basis, until we re-asses in the new year?

If you agree to it, we can continue the 2/2/3 as usual. They would go =
with you this afternoon, come back to me Wednesday, and then go back =
with you Friday afternoon. (They will see both of us on Christmas day, =
which is the same as it will be on the 7/7, and they will be with you on =
the weekend).

It=E2=80=99s not easy to send this email, but I really believe it's =
better for them.

It=E2=80=99s your call.

Darryl
