Darryl,

Thank you for your response. Your explanation is not clear to me and does
not elevate my concerns.  It sounds like you are saying you are dealing
with depression and anxiety, and if that is the case, I am glad you are
getting help. However, that does not explain why you were brought to ICU on
October 15 or your collapse on July 8th while the girls were in your care.

Kindly advise immediately the reasons that you were brought to ICU  by the
paramedics (I have it recorded as four nights from Oct.15-19).
Additionally, please provide copies of all of the hospital admission,
medical and discharge reports related to your  hospitalization before we
discuss access to the girls.

Thank you,

Cynthia
