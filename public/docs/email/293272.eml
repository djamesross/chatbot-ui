that you can go into the parents dashboard, select add contact, search =
for me using the email <a =

me to her account. Please do not send me a friend request to your =
account because I will not accept it. Once you have added me I will =
change the blocked settings back.</div><div><br></div><div>Please direct =
any communication about this matter to me directly instead of =
communicating through Alice. It is simply not true that adding me as a =
