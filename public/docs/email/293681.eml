Dear Ms. Boyce,

As per status quo, I don=E2=80=99t expect a response, because your client c=
ontinues
to refuse to communicate with me and withhold the girls without
consideration for my rights, for process or procedure, or, most
importantly, the girls.

However, I hold out hope you can convince her, particularly at this time
and following the Chief Justice's recent statements, that witholding my
daughts and refusing to answer questions about their health, amoung many
other issues, must be dealt with urgently and in the best interests of the
girls.

As to their health and well being there is no excuse for an immediate and
genuine answer, and it is unreasaonable not to be kept up to date. I am
their father, your client is withholding them, and this is an unprecedented
world-wide epidemic. Furthermore, it is clear your client is not following
Provincial Health recommendations, which puts the girls at risk.

Initially withholding my daughters and refusing access was the primary
issue and grounds for an urgent motion, but their health and well-being may
be a more pressing and urgent matter. I have a meeting with a lawyer this
week to prepare the documents and will submit them thereafter.

I have raised many concerns, but new issues have arisen that your client
continues to refuse to communicate with me about, that have to do directly
with the girl's health and well-being,

   -

   First, Ontario Public Health states that people over the age of 65,
   especially those with medical conditions, should not be receiving visito=
rs
   unless absolutely necessary. And if so, keeping two meters distance and
   wearing a mask. Why is it that your client brought my daughters to her
   parents, how often is she taking the girls to visit people, and why can =
the
   girls visit people while being told they cannot visit me due to Covid-19=
?
   This undoubtedly confuses the girls, and Charlotte has expressed that
   confusion to me.
   -

   This visit also put her parents at risk, and shows she is not taking
   provincial and municipal recommendations seriously, or is unaware of the=
m.
   Given they are both over 65, and Mr. Morrison has critical health
   conditions, they are put at risk, as well as my daughters. Can Ms. Holme=
s
   guarantee her parents are following the health recommendations, and just=
ify
   that the visit was essential?
   -

   Second, Ms. Holmes' sons can go between your client=E2=80=99s house and =
their
   father's, and this increases the risk of exposure. I=E2=80=99m sure Mr. =
Leclair is
   doing his best, but can you guarantee the boys are following regulations
   when moving between houses, and if visiting friends?
   -

   This also puts the girls at further risk, and again further confuses
   them. Why is your client telling my daughters the pandemic prevents them
   from seeing me, but does not apply to their brothers? This is a cause of
   confusion at a stressful time in their lives. They were told they could =
not
   exercise the same freedom with me due to Covid-19 at some point after sh=
e
   decided to withhold them from me. Ms. Holmes appears deliberately confus=
ing
   the girls, and makes no attempt to inform me of what she has told them,
   which causes further confusion.
   -

   The girls also have thoughts and feelings, and children often don=E2=80=
=99t
   share them with adults, or are even fully aware of them. They may be
   worried about me during this pandemic, and since your client told them I
   was sick, when I was not, at a time death counts are announced daily, th=
is
   may be a cause of undue stress and anxiety. This shows insufficient
   understanding or concern for the girls=E2=80=99 emotional well-being.
   -

   Your client may be putting the girls at risk unnecessarily, but will not
   communicate with me, and they are deliberately being confused with
   contradictory information, further compounded by withholding all
   information from me.
   -

   Why is it that your client=E2=80=99s actions are directed at limiting co=
ntact
   with me whenever possible, refusing any options between the shared
   parenting time we reached in the summer, and her decision to completely =
cut
   off contact aside from limited FaceTime? And when it comes to FaceTime, =
why
   does your client insist on limiting and controlling communication?
   Charlotte is capable of using the technology necessary to FaceTime calls
   without your client's constant interference, and does not need your clie=
nt
   to set times and initiate calls.
   -

   Finally, considering her refusal to allow the girls any contact, it has
   been a treat to FaceTime with them a little longer the past three days, =
but
   given Covid-19, and isolation, there is no reason to restrict them from
   calling me if they want to, or cutting our conversations abruptly and
   telling them to get off when there is no pressing reason.
   -

   As an example, recently the girls made plans to watch a show with me at
   a set time, and Ms. Holmes was made aware of the plans, yet changed thos=
e
   plans so that when I called a movie had been started which caused confus=
ion
   for Charlotte. The children should never be put in the middle, or, as yo=
u
   have said, used as pawns.
   -

   When looked at together, I cannot speak to her thoughts or motivations,
   all of her actions and decisions are directed at ensuring I have as litt=
le
   contact as possible, and what contact I do have is restricted and
   controlled.


Clearly your client feels she has the authority she and the privilege to
execute each of the decisions she has made, ignoring the settlement and
agreement we came to in 2018 to return to shared parenting time.

What is your client=E2=80=99s long term plan?

Where are all the access offers both you and your client promised in
emails?

Why has she ignored the fact that CAS decided not to investigate her recent
allegation?

After voluntarily providing medical documents, on what basis does your
client claim to be better suited to assess my health?

And finally, after meeting all the criteria your client demanded, did she
take the most drastic step to withhold my daughters, which is now a clear
pattern?

I urge you to convince your client that an immediate settlement would be a
far better option than using the court and going through a trial, and a
step toward taking the girls=E2=80=99 best interests into account. Unfortun=
ately,
by using her control over the girls and apparent intent on continuing to
restrict all access, she leaves me no other option, unless she is willing
to accept a settlement.

I kindly await a response,

Darryl
