Hi. I did send you the plans at the beginning of summer with an outline of t=
heir weeks. You are getting full days with them during the week and weekend p=
lus overnights. I don=E2=80=99t think a set schedule is achievable for the r=
est of the summer as plans are different from week to week.

 I do make an effort for the girls to have quality time with you and this ha=
s been consistent.=20

Unfortunately,  I won=E2=80=99t be able to accommodate a visit before Saturd=
ay, which is three days of not seeing them.=20

The girls have an active social life , I think we are doing a good job of ba=
lancing it all.=20
