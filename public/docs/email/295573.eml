I=E2=80=99ve missed birthdays, special occasions, daily life, and court-ord=

visitation. Every step has been taken to ensure I cannot parent. You refuse
to communicate with me about any issues or moving forward for the benefit
of the girls. Of course, we=E2=80=99re not going to find a solution tonight=
. I
don=E2=80=99t know if I ever will because you treat me as though I am not t=

father, I'm irrelevant, and I have never felt more hatred. If you won=E2=80=
=99t
communicate with me, this will take months if not years, and a lot of
money. Yet, I hold out hope we can find a way to communicate as so many
parents do, and that you will stop restricting me from their lives.

But for tomorrow, I hope we can make a small compromise. The girls
mentioned you have a camera facing out your front door. I'm guessing a
google, alexa or some other version. They're handy and secure, and I have
no complaints. In fact, If I walk over, from they side your door is on,
walk up the driveway, set the baskets down, and walk back down to the
sidewalk and return home, you will have it on camera. I will not knock,
ring the doorbell, and be very quiet. This is a reasonable compromise that
I can see no objections to.

Do you see any reason to object?

Darry
