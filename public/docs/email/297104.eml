Hi Any,

I=E2=80=99d like to pursue the defamation case against Cynthia. I =
re-read her affidavit, and knowing it=E2=80=99s a pubic document I just =
can=E2=80=99t let it stand. It could be so damaging if someone were to =
read it - a potential employer, a student, or, worst of all, my =
daughters. And it=E2=80=99s more than just the molestation charge. She =
makes me out to be psychiatric mess, a manipulative husband, and a scary =
and emotionally abusive step-father. She has truly tried to destroy my =
character.=20

I won=E2=80=99t let Cynthia know until access to the girls is set up, =
but I think it might be a good strategy to hit her with it very soon =
after, when she=E2=80=99s still feeling off balance. She may even agree =
to a settlement, once it becomes clear how many times she lied in her =
affidavit. I have so many emails, text messages, medical records, and =
witnesses to support my case, and her accusations are just so far =
fetched.

What I would want from this is an admission that her statements are =
false. I don=E2=80=99t care if she makes excuses - something about =
stress, marriage break-up, medication, past trauma, whatever. As long as =
the record is corrected.  I think that she should also make a financial =
settlement. She should pay for the mess she has created. As you pointed =
out - she=E2=80=99s cost so many people so much time, and she=E2=80=99s =
likely to do it again to someone else.

But I could take or leave the money. It=E2=80=99s the record that really =
matters to me. I became curious about my own family history a couple of =
years ago, after hearing different versions from each side of the =
family. I did an online search and I was able to pull up documents from =
the early 80s, filed in British Columbia. I can=E2=80=99t accept the =
chance that  my children or grandchildren do the same in the future.=20

Is this something that you can handle, or will I need to speak to =
someone else?

What are your thoughts?

Darryl
