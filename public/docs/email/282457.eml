I have been happy with the girls spending time with you and I can see they
are becoming quite attached. I am upset, however, that on three separate
occasions visits have been canceled for illness or a sprained foot. During
that time, there is little to no communication for long stretches of time
and I have no idea how Darryl is doing and when the girls will see him
again. This is really hard on the girls and me.

I am asking that if there is a need to cancel that I be informed right away
and that I am given an update on your health and when you can expect to see
the girls. I would like to keep the days consistent so we can all plan and
anticipate visits.

Darryl and I are meeting with CAS this week to discuss next steps and I am
supportive of the girls seeing their dad. I really want to keep with the
consistent schedule so we can all plan ahead, I am hoping with the new
routines the Fall brings it will be easier to plan visits ahead of time.

Cheers,

Cynthia
