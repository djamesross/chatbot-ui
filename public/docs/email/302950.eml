Hi Jane,

I=E2=80=99m stuck on the affidavit. I have a good idea of what I want  =
and need to include, and can write it very quickly if focused. But =
things are still happening, there has been so much that has happened, =
that I=E2=80=99m finding it almost impossible to focus.

I would find an example affidavit extremely useful to get the form =
right, wording, and scope, but of course using only me experiences, =
examples and evidence. Is there a database that I can search, or are =
court documents available?

Als0, are family court motions open to the public? If so, I would sit in =
on one or two.
