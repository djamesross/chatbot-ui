Hi Darryl,

Thanks for your suggestion, let me speak with the girls and get back to you=
.

If we go ahead today the girls would actually be at my mom=E2=80=99s church=
 at Knox
United.

My mom like yours, does not like driving in the dark much. Thus it would be
me picking them up.

I have cc=E2=80=99d my mom and Holly as I want to make sure we are in the s=
ame
page.

The forecast is calling for as much as 100 cm of snow between about 3 pm an=
