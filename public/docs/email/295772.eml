Given the time the girls lost with me last weekend, I will not consider =
extra time.  You can pick them up Friday at, but  no earlier than, 3:30, =
and drop them off Sunday no later than 3:30. I will  not agree to any =
extra time this weekend. To be clear: I will not release the girls until =
Friday at 3:30, and following our parenting agreement I expect them back =
Sunday at 3:30. If they are not back, I will consider it a breach of our =
agreement, call the police, and take legal action.

In the meantime, you have a lawyer to consult, who can advise you on the =
the appropriate legal steps available to you, rather than making =
threats, or acting arbitrarily. Recall: we agreed, in writing, with =
witnesses, to joint custody, which you have repeatedly ignored.
