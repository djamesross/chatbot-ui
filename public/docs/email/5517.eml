Hi,=20

I'm glad you reached out, I think more communication is a good thing. I can a=
ssure you I wasn't drinking when I met your mom, but I know it will take som=
e time to build trust.

I met with Lynda today and understand your reservations more, and why I'll o=
nly meet with the girls on weekends with Dennis for now. I really appreciate=
 your mom's efforts, and hope to earn her trust again soon too. And I will n=
ever drink when I'm seeing the girls (again, I know it will take time to bui=
ld that trust).

I do want to thank you and your parents for the visits. I'm really working h=
ard, and using all the resources I can access to get back to the dad they gr=
ew up up with. I'm meeting with Lynda again in two weeks, and hope to involv=
e Angie and Todd, and hopefully we can take some of the pressure off of your=
 parents.

In the meantime, I want to thank-you for being supportive, and let you know I=
 miss you and the boys.

I've got a few things packed, including Char's scooter. Ali really couldn't t=
hink of anything she wanted, so maybe you can try to find out if she wants a=
nything. I've got lots of clothes, and I'll go through them and drop some of=
f sometime this weekend.=20

For Char's birthday I got her stickers and two outfits for her dolls. I'll d=
rop off some stuff tonight (the dolls, and she wanted her scooter), and mayb=
e give her the presents when I see her, or drop them off before her birthday=
.=20

I talked to Any today and after Lynda's advice I hope we can stop using lawy=
ers. CAS will provide someone to mediate for us, but I hope we can talk more=
. I think we can work this out, even if it's hard at times.

Darryl=20
