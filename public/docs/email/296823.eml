Hello Darryl. I listened to the recording and it seems pretty clear that Be=
n has been in the same bed as Charlotte but that he has not touched her ina=
ppropriately.  However, as you know, children are not the best at recountin=
g events. Dr. Harrison or Charlotte's family doctor may want to speak with =
her to get more information. In light of the recording, I am certainly less=
 concerned about any abuse.

Of course, all this being said I will make sure the kids' personal space is=
