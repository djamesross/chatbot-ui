I know and and respect that it is your weekend but would you happen to have
just a few minute for a question that matters today, and is related to the
fact that she has further limited my visitation, made it more stringent and
forced me to cancel plans I made with the girls, which he agreed to in
which she overheard me talk about to the girls well in speakerphone  her
argument is that I was rude to her mother wishes unreasonable who's over
hurt by my mother and is untrueompletely unreasonable because her mother
claims I was rude to her. her mother was on the phone immediately and
Cynthia who apparently could not supervise or refuse to supervise or be
around me was there within minutes and remained there the entire time. My
understanding and I could be totally wrong is that Cynthia has no right to
withhold my right to see the girls or the girls right to have maximal
contact with me because her mother's feelings were hurt, whether they were
or not which is a totally different debate and doesn't need to be gotten
into.  My mother was there and overheard the conversation is overheard the
conversation and it was respectful. I thanked her quite emotionally for the
time that she did supervise when it was necessary and I was genuine, it  it
was needed for a while and I have been very clear on that but now it is
interference it is intimidation and it is control and it is no longer
needed.  Her mum never should have been there.

Just prior to this Cynthia and I had agreed to a number of visits which she
then refused and denied and changed and has set new restrictions including
one that says that I can only meet the girls at Indigo or a library even
though the girls and I have had plans to see Frozen 2 since we saw the
traier (yes Frozen is my second favourite movie after Moana and the girls
and I watch both movies constantly when we are together and it's movie.
night). I spoke to them on a  rare occasion rare when she would allow me to
and of course on speakerphone where her voice was coming so she has heard
how excited they were and how much they're looking forward to seeing the
film me in particular and no one else   When I spoke to them  last night
after having warned her that she would have to explain to them why they
cannot see the movie with me they did not know that we couldn't see the
movie and they were disappointed and all I could say was I'm sorry girls I
don't have an answer for you you're going to have to ask your mom. I don't
know if it was the best answer but but I can't lie to them and nor will I
denigrate their mother to them. After I quit drinking she insisted with our
case worker who worked with me and convinced me that the girls deserved an
open and honest answer at the ge and so we told them, yet to date they have
not been told a single reason as to why they cannot see me regularly, often
and reliably, why they cannot visit where I live, nor why plans for last
three days have been cancelled. On speakerphone she heard and she knew that
and she is saying that I cannot take them to the movie. However if she
offered that I see them at Indigo which is right beside the movie theatre
and is a place where her fear of me taking the girls which I have never
done ever and finally explained to her that even if I wanted to it would
severely hurt my case and so would be foolish, ther iss far more likelyhood
that I am capable who's doing so compared to an enclosed constrained place
like a movie theatre, so this is obviously a Petty backlash and is punitive
directed toward me but has the effect of being punitive on the girls  what
I would like to know is what would happen if I met them and I told her I'm
taking the girls in the movie I've already bought the ticket for a she
knows that, i told her that she owes me a refund and she did not respons,
what would happen I was perfectly cooperative with our agreement? She could
call the police again but they have nothing to enforce short of me taking
the girls away for days or weeks if they would they would they actually
responded would that be me putting undue stress on the girls on my part
spaceor would that be letting the girls see that their father doesn't act
at the whim of their mother, who they recognized acts irrationally and
without justificattion or grounds.

Again I know it's the weekend but I would really appreciate your opinion on
this because over and over again I simply bow to her mother's demands and I
know that I have to impart because of the standing temporary order, but
she's also be using a temporary order because it is supposed to be
temporary assistance for extreme circumstances and the summer proved that
she has no concerns and shows that I was used simply as child care until
her parents returned at which point she revoked almost complete access.  If
it won't hurt my case and if it would show how unreasonable she is being I
would be happy to inform her when I meet them at Indigo which is right
beside the movie theatre that I'm walking over to the movie to see the
movie, that she's welcome to come but sit apart from us, and that I will be
leaving the girls with her after the movie so as not to break out
agreement, which she's constantly in breach of because she refuses to
negotiate on who will supervise, she dictates where when and who I can see
my daughters, and does so without notice or concern for my work or
schduke.  She is a little dictator who acts like a big dictator, and the
girls have watched me give in to her over and over and over again clearly
learning hat she has complete and absolute power. She seems to have gotten
ahead not because of what's right or what's in the best interest of the
girls but because she simply acts, she makes decisions reactively by her
own gut and follows through with them and that seems to work for her, while
I try to follow the rules as close as I can and that seems to work against
me over and over again. In family law today does the principle of maximal
contact still apply particularly given that I am now passed a year of
complete sobriety, my liver enzymes are back to norma, and I will  have
letters from each of the health providers that I've worked with that are
supportive caring and completely go against what she claims and yet she
continues to treat me as though I live in the street and I have a heroin
addiction. I know that  motion still is in place but I have to believe that
a judge will see it as having been necessary at the time and temporary and
recognize that Cynthia was happy to work with me ntil it didn't suit her
any longer. She is abusing the motion in the intent behind it.

If don't hear from you I will cooperate because I want to see my girld
first and I don't need to risk putting myself in a bad position, but she
has just been all over the place offering me a schedule reneging on the
schedule stating that I can see the girls in some places and then not other
places and then changing her mind and so on and so on  she is erratic and
this is not fair to me but I don't think it matters what it seems like is
that she is either deliberately or without thought ignoring or overriding
the rights of the girls who deserve two healthy and involved parents in
their life, along with consistency.  And I say that to you only because I
know I can't claim she's psychologically unhealthy and then ask for shared
custody but that's the case, their home is erratic and they desperately
want to see me they love spending time with me and they're upset when they
have to leave or rather when they're taken away I've stopped taking the
role of being the one who has to take him to the car and buckle them in and
instead I've I've simply left it up to whoever she decides will supervisor
to ask them or tell them or force them to leave and that has been her mom
or her stepdad and they have been getting more and more angry at the girls
for not cooperating. Again I don't encourage the girls to stay I don't
interfere but I don't help and I don't tell the girls you have to go and
it's for the best  I just can't do that anymore, her mom or her step-dad is
in a rush because they have to meet some plans that limit our time together
which clearly means that her mom's choir practice or her dad's hobby is far
more important and than the fours hours week the girls get with me, can
places that fancy make parenting very difficult.

Anyhow unless I hear back from you, and I apologize for bringing soul up
now on a Sunday, as well as any spelling errors I'm using the Google voice
rather than typing so please forgive any typos and thank you again Jane.

re:<br><br>Hi Jane,<br><br>I=E2=80=99ve sort of frozen up on this issue. Th=
e events, our life, marriage, all of it, feels so overwhelming. <br><br>The=
 girls absolutely love to eee me, come running, and we hug and talk and pla=
y the whole time. After the debacle where Cynthia threatened supervised acc=
ess sites, not a word has been said but her parents have continued to super=
vise. However, now that the weather is cold they spend upwards of 80% of th=
e time=C2=A0 in their car, out of site. There is clearly no fear of me flee=
ing with the girls. <br><br>Also, is it not incumbent upon the parent seeki=
ng supervised access to prove their case? And is it not a case about the ch=
ild=E2=80=99s right to have maximum time with their parents (me). <br><br>I=
 have been afraid to look thought the documents, just feeling overwhelmed I=
=E2=80=99ll find something that will cause me to lose them. But I=E2=80=99v=
e been reading law books and journals and it seems nearly unprecedented for=
 a mother to, on her own and against CAS recommendations, such radical rest=
rictions.<br><br>Furthermore, as the weather gets colder her parents are wi=
lling to do less. But should this not be about them or me, but about the gi=
rl=E2=80=99s rights? <br><br>I need to bring a motion as soon as possible. =
It=E2=80=99s been long already, I=E2=80=99m facing financial hardship, and =
the girls are telling more about how things are not going well at their mot=
her=E2=80=99s house. <br><br>She has: unjustified claims, including people =
who have had no contact with me since I quick drinking. I have letters from=
 addiction counsellor, family dr. Dr. Willows, head of additions at the Roy=
al who completely reversed her extended intreatementn as was very happy wit=
h how I am doing.<br><br>What if she claims it=E2=80=99s a temporary measur=
e to overcome a cautious custodial parent, which would undermine the argume=
nt that the onus is on her. Except that we have the summer, cooperation, te=
st, emails, and on and on.<br><br>I=E2=80=99m meeting with them tomorrow 1 =
to 3, not at 11 as I initially said. But I understand if you want to wait u=
ntil Monday.<br><br>Thank you again.<br><br>Darryl<u></u><u></u></p></block=
