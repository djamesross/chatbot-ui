Hi, thank you for the information I'll make sure to get tickets for the
shows.

I set up Charlotte's vector by setting up an email account for her but to
do so I had to set up family link through Google so it's connected to mine.
It's a safety/age thing, and I think you can be connected to it as well. it
doesn't give me any information about location or anything that she's doing
or anything like that it just verifies that an adult is approving the
account and monitoring it. She should remember it, and you can test her for
fun. But it is charkateri@gmail.com and the password is Cdbsca1!

You should be able to download the app on any phone and login although she
can do everything by voice with it or she should be able to I think.
