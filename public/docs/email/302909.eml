Hey,

We=E2=80=99re back at the house. Girls did great biking. We=E2=80=99re =
going to go to the park, probably until about 5:30. They know they=E2=80=99=
re getting a serious shampoo-soak and comb session tonight.=20

For tomorrow, let me know about any set time they need to be picked up. =
I think by the time we get up, eat and get dressed, we can head out to =
the garage sales by 9:00-9:30, and won=E2=80=99t last more than an hour =
and half, maybe two. Does that work for you?=20
