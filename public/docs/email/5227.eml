=EF=BB=BFHi Cynthia,

Thank you for agreeing to meet today for an hour, and allowing the girls to h=
ave a Father=E2=80=99s day.=20

I=E2=80=99ve attached the information document I mentioned before for you. I=
 expect you to keep it private, and to not share it with others. I will shar=
e information with other people when I choose too, and to avoid confusion an=
d rumours that people might feel or share.

I will be in contact with your lawyer to discuss the issues you raised once I=
 am settled and able to use the phone and internet.

Sincerely,

Darryl
