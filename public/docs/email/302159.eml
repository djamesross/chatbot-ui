course, but I did go and pulled her record. And I found the attending =

to pursue the allegations.

without sounding crude. But here I go: I found out from Cynthia=E2=80=99s =
affidavit that she accused me of sexually assaulting Charlotte, our =
oldest daughter. 9 days after she left the house, and 3 days after she =
was served by a motion from my lawyer, she submitted Charlotte to an =
examination at CHEO, claiming that she believed I sexually assaulted =
Charlotte.<br class=3D"">&gt;<span =
class=3D"Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br class=3D"">&gt; It was =
14 days before I finally got to see the girls again, which was the =
longest and hardest time of my life. At times, not infrequently, I truly =
felt like my heart hurt. In fact, I=E2=80=99m convinced that it did. And =
I felt pain worse than any physical trauma I have yet received. All I =
can I say is holy fuck that hurt. And jesus-fucking-christ I would =
rather suffer a compound fracture. Only a few people truly understand =
that I was both mother and father to my daughters, but luckily my lawyer =
is one of them.<br class=3D"">&gt;<span =
class=3D"Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br class=3D"">&gt; And I =
worked with my lawyer (as my bill reveals, hence my tight purse of =
late). I followed up every lead that I could (I joked about billing them =
but am considering a career change). I went to the police station, to =
CHEO, and spoke to CAS. I worked up a detailed timeline, I plotted her =
claims, versus my evidence, and cross-referenced the audio recordings. =
As for the authorities, Cynthia called them all. The police never =
followed up, CHEO found no signs of sexual abuse (of course, but I did =
go and pulled her record. And I found the attending nurse, who helped me =
decipher the medical record, and sopped up my tears). Luckily, the =
investigator from CAS did her due diligence - she met with both the =
police and CHEO and concluded that there was no reason to pursue the =
allegations.<br class=3D"">&gt;<span =
class=3D"Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br class=3D"">&gt; Now, up =
to that point Cynthia was sticking to her guns: she was =E2=80=9Conly =
following=E2=80=9D the investigation, and asked only that we wait for =
the investigation to run it=E2=80=99s course. Only when I met with the =
CAS did they reveal that they never had cause for concerns, beyond her =
accusations. (And there were so many more lies too=E2=80=A6) So with =
that out of the way, she happily=E2=80=A6 made up new excuses. Yes, she =
did.<br class=3D"">&gt;<span =
class=3D"Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br class=3D"">&gt; But =
long story short, I=E2=80=99ve got the girls for now, and she=E2=80=99s =
crumbling. But not without demanding the house, the van, child support, =
and everything else in the world. And you=E2=80=99ll appreciate this - =
she wants a week-on, week-off schedule, because she=E2=80=99s now =
sharing custody with Scott, the boys=E2=80=99 father. (And you=E2=80=99ll =
appreciate this even more: in her affidavit she says that they=E2=80=99ve =
