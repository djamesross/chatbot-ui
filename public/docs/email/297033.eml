Hi Any,

I just wanted to check in to hear if there has been any movement about =
finances, and ask a quick question: I=E2=80=99m going to keep Ali home =
one day a week, and I assumed that would save me $50 a week, while =
Cynthia would continue to pay the same (so I=E2=80=99d be paying for 3 =
days every two weeks, and she would pay for 5). Is that correct?

Darryl
