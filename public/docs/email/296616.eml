Hi Sharon,



I=E2=80=99ve realized I really do need help. I know how professional you ar=
e but
Cynthia is punishing me and displaying a real hatred toward me, which I
would not ask for help with. But it is hurting the girls.



For example aand a small one, I had long standing plans to see Frozen II
wit the girls, had purchased the tickets, and the girls were so excited.
She was aware because she tightly control phone calls and they are always
on speakerphone. However, the day before her mother claimed I hurt her
feelings (she may have felt so but I did not), and so Cynthia set in place
a new set of rules, and prevented me from a scheduled vist the following
evening. I was only allowed to see the girs at indigo and was not allowed
to take them to the movie. It was made clear the police would be called if
I did, even though it is next to indigo, has fewer exists and is therefore
easier to monitor. And her rtigger is the fear that I will take the girls,
which months and many opportunities have proven I will not. She doesn=E2=80=
=99t
seem to understand I will not do that to the girls and it would cement her
case, should she bring one. Nevertheless her stepfather supervised by not
paying any attention to where we were or what we were doing. IT was
punitive directed at me but hurt the girls. I was told Charlotte was sick,
but once her mother left she told me she was sad because we couldn=E2=80=99=
t see
the movie, and had been given no reason.

It also come to my attenton that there is much conflict in the house, and
the most hurtful person is Cynthia,. She avoid parenting as much as
poissible, yet prevents me from seeing the girls whenever she can, or
dictates supervised visits that make meanfinfl interaction difficult to
impossible.

Her parents are getting sick of supervising, so last week when there was
ice but no snow she suggested I come take the girls tobogganing. There is
no washroom, store or caf=C3=A9 to warm up or get a warm drink, and she wou=
ld
have had one of her sons meet me at the house. She=E2=80=99s literally all =
over the
place. In that case she simply diidn=E2=80=99t have her parents available n=
ut kows
not to completely deny me access, while refusing any other supervisors.


I honestly don't know if you can help, but I'm reaching out in case because
I am truly worried about my daughters first and foremost, as well as
myself. I'm not a risk to myself or anyone else, but I have been crying
more often and find the injustice of this situation harder and harder to
bear. (I am open with my sleep doctor and psychiatrist, and my family
docto, and monitoring myself.)


Darryl
