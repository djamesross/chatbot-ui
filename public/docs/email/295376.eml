Confidential & non prejudicial,

There are still no reasons to justify access, or the control over when =
and for how long I can see the girls, but given it=E2=80=99s the only =
choice I will take it for now to be able to see them.

Can your mom meet us at Levesque Park, in Stonebridge? The girls would =
really enjoy it.

For now I=E2=80=99ll wait to plan time with Char for her birthday, but =
will be in touch about it soon.
