Hi,

So I did get the fax sent in time for the Feb. 8 start date, according to wh=
at our case worker told me. She said it takes about 2 business days for her t=
o receive it, so I=E2=80=99ll get in touch with her Monday and then I should=
 be able to confirm it.

My pay is still not correct. There are two issues. The first is that they ma=
de a mistake and paid me sick leave when it should have been regular pay. Th=
e second is that the college changed to an entirely new payroll system, so a=
ll of HR, the payroll department, and managers are scrambling to fix errors a=
nd correct problems across the college.

I will update you when I have spoken to FRO. I will also update you about ar=
rears once I have confirmation about my pay from HR. I will be meeting with m=
y manager and with HR next week.

Darryl=
