Hi Darryl,
I spoke with our case worker Andrea yesterday and she advised me that our
case is open and that are awaiting to get some more information from you as
well as funds. As for the next $450 payment due this Friday, please arrange
to have it sent to FRO via transfer  and they can send it to me ASAP.

I have confirmed in writing that you have already sent me $450 from early
January 2019.

As for the $40 additional funds you sent me last week, I have put it
towards the daycare amount you owed in December which still has a balance
of $180. Please send the remaining of this separately to me via e-mail
transfer so I don't have to go through FRO again.

FRO received the statement of arrears that was signed in the presence of my
lawyer back in November. Please discuss with FRO how you can make
arrangements with them to pay back this outstanding balance  through their
office.

Thanks,

Cynthia
