Hi Jennifer,

I have to say that I am so disappointed in how this has been handled, and
you will have to find of a way of actually getting in contact with Cynthia
if you want any of the money back or the piano. I had a chance to mention
it to her and she seemed to have no idea what I was talking about, in fact
tonight she was hot yoga when we had switched so that the girls could have
piano lessons. So what is happening with that piano I have no idea.

But I do know and that the children's aid society was used several times by
someone with a long history of false accusations.

Cynthia worked well when we worked with CAS cooperatively and while I
worked incredibly hard, harder than I could ever have imagined, to get
over what was the most horrible thing I have ever experienced aside from
the initial breakdown when she took the girls away and accused me of
molesting Charlotte.

And then the case was closed, Cynthia is quoted as saying she is not
concerned that I'm drinking and that I am a great father, and for the
summer I was great childcare, after her parents left and she was told told
there is no need for restrictions and that we should work until together
which would be best for the girls. And they are who counts, they are who
matters, except they don't. I'd go through that hell again if it would
prevent them from having to go through what they're going through now.
They're changing. them are more anxious, distracted, they can't focus as
well, they don't do as well at school, and they're confused and given lies
about why they can only see me for 3 and 1/2 to 4 hours a week supervised.
Solely based on Cynthia's self given authority. I consistently and placed
last and told exactly when I can see them regardless of what is going on in
my life or what responsibilities do I have.

I moved to a place where they could flourish and she knew that and waited
until I had moved and committed to tell me that I would not be allowed to
see the girls. She has given me at least four different reasons, her and
her lawyer ignore me, then promise to talk to me, and then ignore me, and
it's hurting the girls. Her sons have not fared any better. Ben was taken
to cheo for hurting himself and threatening suicide. She's admitted to
physically abusing him. Charlotte has told me how scared she's been when
her mom gets mad, and I was just told me how mean her mom has been to her
whenever she says she misses me. They're not allowed to call me on the
phone I have to call her cell phone karma and she makes sure that the phone
calls are very short and on speakerphone.

Krystale, you'll remember when Cynthia made it clear that the girls had to
be told exactly why I was sick and why that was important. Cynthia claimed
they needed the truth. Where's that truth now?

But you can do nothing so I hope you get the piano back and the money while
I quickly go into bankruptcy, while doing everything I can for my
daughters. And yes I screwed up. And I mean huge, and while I am a great
father I'm not perfect, but I made it right and worked in good faith with
her. And yet here we are. I know that physical abuse and much worse things
happen to children, but Charlotte and Alice deserve so much more, I have so
much potential, but not with somebody who is inconsistent, can be scary,
and clearly once to punish me at the expense of two amazing people.

I know you can't do anything, but I just felt like I had to say that. I'm
just so disappointed after so much work, after all the resources you put
in, and how easy it was for her to just lie.
