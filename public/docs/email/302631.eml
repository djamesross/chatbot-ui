Hi Linda,

Thank-you for the card, I really appreciated it. I=E2=80=99m doing much =
better now and would love to see the girls. The only problem is that I =
can=E2=80=99t leave the hospital property. I can go outside, and there =
is a nice grass area, picnic tables, and a gazebo, but that=E2=80=99s as =
far as I can go.=20

It=E2=80=99s a lot to ask, but I would love to see the girls. I=E2=80=99m =
available today, which is probably too short notice. Tomorrow I have =
special permission to leave to pick up some of my stuff (my mom has to =
pick me up, stay with me, and drop me off, and it=E2=80=99s only for a =
limited time), so I=E2=80=99ll be out from 3:30 until 6 pm, but I=E2=80=99=
m free Friday and over the weekend.=20

Let me know, but I understand either way.

Best,

Darryl=
