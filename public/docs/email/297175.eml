Hi Jane,

That would be great, because it=E2=80=99s not clear to me exactly what =
they mean when read one after the other. I=E2=80=99m going back to the =
Court today when the Family Law centre is open so that I can make copies =
and find out more information. Let me know if you=E2=80=99d like me to =
come in to sign a retainer. I will also be back downtown Monday or =
Tuesday, and can do it then.

I would really like to know exactly what the girls are doing, =
activities, and who is looking after them. Cynthia has always either =
refused to tell me or been vague, and often decides what they will be =
doing without telling me, and often without talking to the girls. Do I =
have the right and should I ask her their schedule, activities, who=E2=80=99=
s caring for them, etc. I=E2=80=99ve also stopped receiving information =
from the school, so I=E2=80=99m going to contact them and ask to be put =
on email lists and to meet with their teachers. Finally, she rarely =
tells me anything about doctor=E2=80=99s appointments, accidents, and so =
on, including a bad sprain and neck injury Charlotte had.

I=E2=80=99d also like to know if it=E2=80=99s relevant to the motion =
that, over 7 to 10 days, went from mutually agreeing on a schedule, to =
informing me I would have a reduced schedule, to further restricting my =
access with the justification that the girls already were booked in =
activities on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday & Friday, which they=E2=80=99ve =
been in for the last several years, and which should not be changed =
because consistency is important. And yet, without informing me, I found =
out that Charlotte is no longer in dance, and they only have two =
activities, Monday and Saturday. Suddenly the week is opened up. Her =
initial argument was for the status quo, which I accept, and then she =
abruptly changed their routine, activities, and schedule, which she said =
she was unwilling to do to allow me to spend time with them.

Finally, I am going to contact their teachers directly for updates. The =
school stopped included me in emails and information. Would you =
recommend I contact the school and ask to be included? Are there any =
rights I might have that I should be exercising in terms of being =
informed, communication, etc.?

Darryl
