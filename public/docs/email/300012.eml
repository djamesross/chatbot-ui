Hi Cynthia,

The forecast is calling for as much as 100 cm of snow between about 3 pm =
and 8 pm which is too much for my mom to drive tonight on highways and =
country roads. The local roads will likely be bad too. She is available =
Wednesday or Thursday.

If the local roads are drivable I propose they be dropped off and picked =
up this evening as usual. Visits have been supervised for 1.5 years now =
and I think it=E2=80=99s time to move to unsupervised visits based on =
the record of the last 18 months of perfect visits. (For comparison, in =
2018 following the direction of CAS they started after one month, so =
it=E2=80=99s been 18x longer). If they are bad, I propose starting =
unsupervised visits Wednesday or Thursday as alternatives.

Please let me know:
- if you are agreeable to moving to unsupervised visits at this time (or =
by the end of this month, January, 2024)
- which evening works best: Wednesday or Thursday
