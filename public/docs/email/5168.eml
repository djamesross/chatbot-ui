Hi Linda and Dennis,

I'm sorry for not getting in touch last week. I had a terrible flu - to the
point where I missed two classes and was semi-delirious with fever for two
days.

I am feeling marginally better, but am no longer contagious, however.

Let me know what works best for you this afternoon. I'm available from 4 pm
on.

And again, my apologies,

Darryl
