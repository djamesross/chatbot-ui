Hi

Sorry I didn't check my e-mail until today. For facetime, please just send
me a text.

As for Sunday, the girls would love to see you. I have agreed for Holly to
be a supervisor provided we speak with Lynda about a few things. Lynda says
she will organize that soon.  Is Holly available to supervise Sunday? Going
forward, Sunday afternoons work well for visits. This will give you more
time with the girls, especially in the nice weather and a chance for Holly
to develop a relationship with them.

Charlotte really wants to learn how to ride her bike and I was hoping you
can help her on your visits. I may need your help adjusting the seat on her
old bike. Are you okay with that?


Cynthia
