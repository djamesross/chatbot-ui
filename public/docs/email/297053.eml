Hi Any,

The house deal didn=E2=80=99t work out. Unfortunately we have to go with =
a realtor.=20

I=E2=80=99ve got a few questions about the approach I=E2=80=99ve been =
taking with Cynthia. While I feel like fighting Cynthia=E2=80=99s =
allegations, I=E2=80=99ve realized that it won=E2=80=99t help the girls. =
Quite the opposite, as you well know. I=E2=80=99d like to start being a =
lot more cooperative with her (without giving up any rights.). I =
realized that the more stressed she is, the harder she is on the kids, =
so I=E2=80=99d like to take some pressure off of her by telling her that =
I=E2=80=99m not going to pursue this in court (assuming nothing else =
comes up!).

One of the issues that I am concerned about are my legal fees. Given =
that her accusations are so ridiculous, I think she should be =
responsible for part of the costs. But realistically, is there any =
chance that I can get her to cover part of them, if we don=E2=80=99t go =
to court?

If I start to be more cooperative with her, and tell her that I=E2=80=99ve=
 decided not to pursue this in court, will I be giving anything up?=20

Finally, I don=E2=80=99t want to give up the option of a custody and =
access assessment. Will this make it harder to get one, if things =
don=E2=80=99t improve?

Any other advice?

Darryl=
