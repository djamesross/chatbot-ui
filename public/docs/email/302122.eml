he children from the house and is refusing to return them. This is a mess.

> As background - I do and have done most of the child care (school, etc.),=
 I am the primary parent for the girls and their main attachment, a family =
counsellor strongly advised her against removing the children (she removed =
my step-sons Thursday night, which the family therapist said was a mistake,=
 and my wife agreed during the meeting). She is claiming that she is scared=
 of me and scared for the children, and I=92m seeing a pattern in her past =
relationships (I=92m the new villain). She has made claims that I have been=
 extremely angry and scared her - but she didn=92t know at the time that I =
was recording those conversations and have shared them with a therapist who=
 believes she is not psychologically healthy. I have lots of recordings.

om the house on Friday. She took them to see their cousins Saturday morning=
, and then told me Saturday afternoon that she would not let me see them.
