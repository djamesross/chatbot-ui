sharing some information about your unpredictable and ever-changing =
ideas about how everyone=E2=80=99s lives and relationships have to be =
controlled. But Really, Cynthia, this is ridiculous and unjustifiable. =
Did ya ask me about arrangements? Did ya check with CAS if it=E2=80=99s =
appropriate? I know you didn=E2=80=99t ask me or the girls. Any parent =
with concerns would ask. Instead, you acted in bad faith, planned this =

you really expect me to take this seriously, when you have not asked me =

time when a conversation would have clarified this. And what about when =
she finds out you are wrong about the arrangements?</div><div =
class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">So, you barely =
communicate wth me, have refused my attempts to try to start =
conversations, make false assumptions, and go immediately to the most =
extreme step possible. Yet, up to now you have agreed to more and more =
time, to the point of half time, and sleep overs as long as 5 days. Once =
you have even said no to four, then asked me to keep them an extra night =
for your convenience. You absolutely refused 3.5 days, but 3 is fine, =
but then for a year you can only accept two. You=E2=80=99re all over the =
place, and that speaks to state of mind.</div><div class=3D""><br =

no longer required or recommended. Krystle repeated that to you, to make =
it clear. &nbsp;CAS doesn=E2=80=99t support your justification, they =

already said and documented, and they get taken seriously in =
court.</div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></div><div class=3D"">You are =
aware this is the worst possible way of handling custody concerns for =
the children, and research makes that very clear. So why do it this way? =
Why chose to do it the hardest most conflictual way as your first step? =
I have a reasonable alternative: put your proposal on hold for a week or =
two, deal with your feelings, and then do what divorced parents do when =
they make decisions for their children: take the step of actually =
talking to me, develop some basic working way of communicating, for the =

why it=E2=80=99s a great place for the girls so you=E2=80=99re informed. =
