Hi Darryl.

It=E2=80=99s too much too ask to bring more of the costume. Let=E2=80=99s ju=
st keep it to the horn and bracelet, the girls are thrilled with just that.

As for the visit today, your message is a bit confusing. My mom suggested th=
e Chapters at Pinecrest and then IKEA as it supposed to rain. But I will lea=
ve it to you and my mom to confirm the location, time and details.


See you tmrw.

Thanks for your message. For the costumes, let=E2=80=99s keep it simple, the=

As for Halloween, Charlotte made plans with Elyse and is being picked up at 5=
40. I plan to take Alice with some friends around that time. If you are comf=
ortable you can pop by quickly at 515 to see the girls in their costumes. Do=
es that work?<br>

The weather is not great for tmrw. Can we plan to meet at Indigo in Barrhave=
