Firstly, I am deeply concerned about the draft order, the letter, and =
the potential consequences of missing the deadline as outlined in the =
letter.

The draft order sent by Ms. Boyce on April 27 appeared to be identical =
to the draft order you previously mentioned was held back while =
revisions were being made. In fact, the draft order I received on May 5 =
was exactly the same as the one prepared for Ms. Holmes. There were no =
changes made.

The email I received on May 5 did not include any mention of a deadline =
or the letter from Ms. Boyce, which outlined the consequences of missing =
the deadline set for the past Sunday, May 7. Although I understood there =
was some urgency when we spoke on Monday afternoon, I was not informed =
about the deadline, let alone that it had passed. I was also not privy =
to these details when we spoke yesterday afternoon.

My concern is that I only became aware of the letter and the deadline =
because I specifically asked for a copy of the email and attached draft =
order, due to concerns about a scheduled FaceTime visit on Thursday.

As of today, May 10, it has been 13 days since I received the email from =
Ms. Boyce with the attached documents.

I am highly concerned that this will become the final version of the =
order. Please let me know if there has been any communication with Ms. =
Boyce to ensure that it will not be.

Secondly, regarding your question about virtual parenting time on =
Thursdays, there has been ongoing interference with scheduled FaceTime =
visits. Last Thursday, after a scheduled visit was cancelled, I became =
aware that Ms. Holmes had hired a tutor for our daughters on Thursday =
afternoons. This development is likely to cause issues with the time she =
proposed in her draft of the order. More specifically, she hired a tutor =
for our daughters on April 29, just two days after Ms. Boyce sent the =
draft order on April 27. This decision could lead to future issues and =
interference. Ms. Holmes did not inform me about her decision or why she =
hired a tutor. My oldest daughter seems unaware of the purpose of the =
tutor, merely stating that it's just a free service provided by the =
school.

However, the school does not provide free tutoring. Ms. Holmes hired a =
tutor at her own expense, without providing any explanation to me either =
before or after the fact. They are not lagging in any subject, and =
there's no specific topic or subject for which the tutor was hired. My =
daughter couldn't tell me what they were working on or why she was =
getting tutored.

Ms. Holmes has repeatedly enrolled the girls in activities that =
interfere with or limit my access, without informing or discussing with =
me, only to respond with excuses when I ask for details after the fact.

Finally, I discovered yesterday that on March 16, 2021, two documents =
were uploaded to my eldest daughter's school Google Drive. The first =
document was titled "**2021-03-12 updated draft affidavit Cynthia Holmes =
(1).docx**" and the second was named "**2021-03-12 updated draft =
affidavit Cynthia Holmes (1) (1).docx**". The first document was =
uploaded using my daughter's account, while the second is shared between =
my daughter=E2=80=99s account, Ms. Holmes, and Ms. Holmes's sister, Ms. =
Heather Morrison. Both Ms. Holmes and Ms. Morrison accessed and edited =
the second document on the same day, March 16, 2021. Since then, no =
changes have been made to either document. These documents, stored in my =
daughter's school Drive folder, have been accessible to her for over two =
years, and it's clear she's aware of their existence and contents.

To clarify, the documents that Ms. Holmes uploaded are drafts of her =
affidavit, which are essentially identical to the affidavit included in =
the motion materials served on me on October 1, 2021, and which formed =
the basis of the motion on March 31, 2022. I am now aware that my =
11-year-old daughter, who was 9 when the documents were uploaded, has =
had access to these documents, which encompass most or all of the =
statements, allegations, and arguments, etc., etc., both true and false, =
made by Ms. Holmes, for over two years.

At this point, I do not know whether my daughter has read the documents =
in their entirety, why her mother uploaded them to our daughter's school =
account, and them readily available to her.  I'm unsure if our daughter =
was involved in preparing the affidavit or asked to read them. I'm also =
unclear whether these actions were done with the intention to involve =
our daughter in the legal case, to side with her mother, whether the =
documents were uploaded to her account specifically to be read by her, =
or if this was simply a reckless disregard for our daughter's =
well-being.=20

That this is a serious issue that has direct impact on our daughter=E2=80=99=
s well-being and my relationship with her is clear, but this act also =
stands as a breach of a court order explicitly designed to protect our =
daughters. At present, I am attempting to find the best way to discuss =
this issue with my daughter and support her. It=E2=80=99s going to be =
difficult and will not be addressed easily. It will have lasting effects =
on her, her relationship with me as well as her mother. She should never =
have been exposed to these documents, let alone had them readily =
available to her. I won=E2=80=99t be able to start to talk to her about =
this this until I see her in person, for obvious reasons, until next =
Sunday.

I am trying to understand and make sense of the legal issues raised =
above, the letter provided today, review the order as quickly as =
possible, find a reasonable solution to the issues about scheduling with =
a person who refuses to communicate with me does not agree with the =
judgement, as well as how to talk to and find support for my daughter. =
It is extremely important to me to make sure that the final order is =
exhaustive and comprehensive as well as explicit and detailed so that =
what progress has been made is not lost. I will respond as soon as I =
can.

Please advise regarding the status of the draft order, the deadline she =
set, and if there has been communication, when possible.=20

Thank you,

Darryl
