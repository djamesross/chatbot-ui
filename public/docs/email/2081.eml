Well it is easy when you have been so forthcoming, honest and easy to =

Cindy,

=20

I wanted to send a note to say happy Mother=E2=80=99s day. It=E2=80=99s =
one of those days that can confuse children of modern, blended, and =
complicated families (although so many of us are these days). But it =
seems like the best day to let you know how thankful I am to have you in =
my life.

=20

I popped into your life quite out of the blue, after problems arose with =
my mom. But never once have I felt like I had to prove myself, or that =
you wondered about my loyalty, or my feelings. It still amazes me how =
open and accepting you=E2=80=99ve been, about all things. And you have =
seen me in some of the worst times of my life. You accepted me =
immediately. But you were also there for me when I needed help just to =
see my daughters, you were there for me when I needed help getting a =
car, and you=E2=80=99ve continued to be there for me through everything =
else. And always with a warm hug.

=20

I thank you for your open heart, your acceptance, and your amazing =
energy.

=20

Love,

=20

Darryl
