Hi Holly,

I am agreeable to this arrangement to begin next week if pick up can be at
7 pm.

I understand it=E2=80=99s been a stretch for you and appreciate how reliabl=
e you
have been.


This week both my mom and I are booked solid and cannot drive.

Can we trial this for Easter Sunday with pick up a 7 pm?

Their soccer schedule may change in late April this the week day may be
switched up. Once I know more I can let you know.
