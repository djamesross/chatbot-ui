Ms. Boyce,

I'm writing to inform you that your client, Ms. Holmes, continues to
restrict my access to my daughters by ensuring they are never left alone
with me without justification and has made clear she will call the police
if do not follow her orders exactly. I remind you that she does so against
the recommendations of CAS and involved the Police unnecessarily when I
followed our agreement.

Furthermore, and again without justification, she continues to restrict
visits and to places of her choosing without discussion, and limit them not
according to the girls best interests but to those of her and her parents,
further interfering with my ability to parent my children. She has, again
without explanation, justification or cause, informed me that she will
only allow me to see me daughters at one of two places, one of which is a
toy store and not conducive to quality time.

She continues to interfere with and control how I interact with my
daughters, but more importantly, how they are allowed to develop a
relationship with me independent of her control.

There is absolutely no need for these restrictions, and they in fact are in
direct opposition to my daughters best interests, but accept them on an
interim wihtout prejudice basis because it is the only way your client will
allow me to see my daughters.

Finally, I kindly request confirmation and a response to my previous emails.

Darryl Ross
