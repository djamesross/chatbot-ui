Cynthia,

I remain open to discussing a schedule that works for the girls and us =
and would do so with no interest in arguments, the past, or other =
conflicts. Just to sit down and in a civil way come up with a reasonable =
schedule. Parental conflict, as we learned from child psychologists and =
the research I did on it and shared with you, is the worst possible =
thing that we can do. Or, put differently, it=E2=80=99s  the best way to =
hurt them. I=E2=80=99m doing everything I can to avoid that, and I truly =
believe you don=E2=80=99t want to hurt them either. This can become =
reasonable and agreeable at any point. It has in the past.

In the meantime, there is no justification for complete restriction on =
visitation with the girls, nor can a unilateral limitation be justified =
for a year. You=E2=80=99ve said nothing to indicate you plans, and in =
fact said the opposite on record, and your single justification is not =
true. They will have a room to themselves, which up to know you have =
refused to ask me about. Aside from that you have ony mentioned your =
discomfort, which isn=E2=80=99t justification to decide the must spend =
less time with me, other than your discomfort. Your decision, it will =
also be noted, immediately after I raised the financial agreement we =
made. If you go forward with this, it will hurt me, confuse the girls, =
and cause their father serious financial hardship. I can=E2=80=99t =
believe you want that, regardlrdd of how you feel about me right now.

The court order from January, the one preceding the order you were =
relying on, provide more clairty an should have been shared with the =
police once you decide to call them. It states clearly states I am =
continue to see them on mutually agreeable schedule, and that was not =
changed in the later order. Given those documents, and our original =
agreement, your support of me as a good and caring parent, and how =
closely we worked with CAS, you=E2=80=99re backing yourself further and =
further into an indefensible position. There are other matters too, that =
will be directed to your lawyer and are for her to explain to you, but =
for now all I will point out is under pressure and fear, I agreed, to =
avoid court, to meet in Alison=E2=80=99s office, with just you and her/ =
Aliso did act like our mediator, offering, but her duty is to represent =
you. Furthermore, she offered to do write the final document al the file =
it on our behalf, and you were asking for shared costs. You both knew I =
was in financial hardship, shrugging to overcome addition, and the =
pressures and alternatives that were explained to me seemed worse, but I =
had no one else to provide legal advice. I was very scared at the time =
When the context is taken into place, it becomes a potentially confusion =
even more serious mistake, and explains why I was confused our agreement =
to return to joint custody was not included in the document as =
discussed, but assumed good faith.

But leaving that aside, the only time a parent is legally allowed to =
withhold access from another parent is when safety is a serious and =
justifiable concern, and we know that was not the case, and is not =
currently a conversation. We had am assumed schedule, ad I had plans, =
and disagreed with you. To maintain the status quo and keep plans, the =
reason, where the=E2=80=99d be, and I kept my word. I am the parent who =
has always ket to our agreement. Up ta that point you have objected and =
wold discuss it.  Nevertheless. and fully aware you would probably do =
this,  I dropped the girls off without any need for police involvement =
or threats. And I did so knowing your history and fully expecting and =
fearing this would happen. Whether I was right or wrong, you are acting =
in my favour. Except that I don=E2=80=99t want the favour, and wish it =
were not so. I want time with the girls, but more importantly they  want =
time with me, and everyone has be reporting improvements, only positive =
things and agree I doing much better now that I fought my own battle, =
and have become a present, caring and more involved parent. They don=E2=80=
=99t deserve to be put in the middle of this, and used this way. You had =
many options before the most extreme, which feels like kidnaping, and =
I=E2=80=99ve shown no signs, expressed no intentions, or pose a flight =
risk. Again, this is so extreme and cannot be justified.

I understand you will not do anything before speaking to Alison, but I =
wanted to try one more time, in hopes that some of this may get through, =
and so  that you might raise it with with her, and consider how much =
parental conflict hurts the children, our daughters, and to let you know =
there is no reason it has to go on. There are many other options with =
far less impact on Charotte and Alice, than refusing to let me see the =
at all add reusing a shedule. It doesn=E2=80=99t have to be all or =
nothing, and you don=E2=80=99t have to refuse to share information with =
me. I would encourage you to consider and discuss other options, which =
would have made things so much easier on the girls, including time at a =
park where you or someone else supervises, or a signed agreement stating =
that I will return the girls at an agreed upon time, which the police =
could and would enforce, but which wound=E2=80=99t occur, because I =
would=E2=80=99t subject the girls to that.=20

it is appearing to be a pattern,  once again reacting with the most =
extreme choice of completely withholding the girls and giving me no =
information. You could have taken whatever action you saw fit to take, =
with measure in place to reassure your worries, without dramatically =
changing the status quo, and upending the consistency and security the =
girls developedk making their future uncertain.

It=E2=80=99s worth taking time, and talking to Alison, to consider some =
of these options, and how this affects the girls. I remain open to any =
means of reducing this from high conflict to a disagreement we can work =
out together or in court. In the meantime it simply doesn=E2=80=99t =
warrant such a drastic change to the girls lives. For now, I=E2=80=99ll =
agree to pretty much  anything until this is worked out, on a =
nonprejudicial basis, to maintain normalcy for the girls, and to prevent =
them from wondering if and when they will suddenly be taken again. They =
asked me several times why you were doing this, and as you said after I =
stopped drinking, they deserve an answer, so they can understand. You =
insisted on the matter, and I agree that it=E2=80=99s necessary, in an =
age appropriate way. But I don=E2=80=99t have an answer, not for =
completely refusing contact. Escpeciallly not Ali asked out the blue, =
=E2=80=98but why would a nice mom make me see you less?=E2=80=99 I =
really don=E2=80=99t want the to start to wonder about the =E2=80=98nice=E2=
=80=99 part, truly, but that=E2=80=99s what kids report feeling when =
parent is trying to alienate the other.

In the meantime I=E2=80=99m glad you=E2=80=99re keeping them busy. They =
are excited for horseback riding, school shopping, and I=E2=80=99m glad =
to hear that Char=E2=80=99s birthday is planned for this year. She=E2=80=99=
s very excited, and it sounds like a very nice place to have a party. I =
told them I=E2=80=99m excited to hear how it goes, and was very =
supportive. But that is a short term solution that can=E2=80=99t replace =
their need for me in their life, and the their ability to feel secure =
instead of worried that you may or may not let me see them. As I =
mentioned above I have started to collect the relevant documents, and if =
you refuse to follow the order for a mutually agreed up schedule I will =
be asking Alison for her availability and filing an emergency motion if =
access and custody is not reinstated by the following weekend. I have =
retained legal counsel, add will fight for as long as it takes, within =
the boundaries of the law, but will keep tat separate from the girls as =
much as possible. I have no interests in battles or wins, and remain =
certain that it is hurting the girls.

You know that I will follow this through as far as possible and as long =
as possible because of how strongly and deeply I love them, how attached =
we have remained, and because I love spending time with them, and enjoy =
being their father. They=E2=80=99re my two favourite people. But as =
I=E2=80=99ve said to you and to them, and continue to believe, they will =
do better, be more secure, and feel less concern, with two involved =
parents, rather than one. And because we each add value to their lives, =
in different ways. And I will continue to do everything I can to keep =
conflict between us separate from them, and avoid tactics loke calling =
the police uneccesarily. I made it clear I was followig the amount of =
time we agreed to, and retured them without the need for drama.

There are other choices that can be made, which are far better for the =
girls. I hope you consider and discuss them. Or if you already have, it =
would be a simple matter of letting me know, and show this isn=E2=80=99t =
just about punishing me, or trying to hurt and break me. This has been =
incredibly upsetting, and difficult, and follows the pattens of the =
first, but at this point I am about as close to unbreakable as one can =
get. I=E2=80=99m continuing on and I=E2=80=99m coping, despite how much =
this hurts. I=E2=80=99m preparing for the move, which as you know I =
committed to before you told me of your plan. I=E2=80=99m preparing for =
and looking forward to teaching. I immediately reached out for support, =
and am making sure that I am caring for myself through this period, =
which I learned to do over the past four years. I will continue to make =
it clear to the girls that I=E2=80=99m strong, healthy, and look fo to =
seeing them soon.=20

Aside from special plans and treats, what are you doing to ensure their =
confidence. The have mentioned being afraid to say certain things to =
you, are afraid they=E2=80=99ll upset you. I trust you=E2=80=99ll do =
everything you can to reassure them they are safe, I am heath, and the =
both one the very much.

Char wants to talk again after school Today, and I really want to talk =
to them again and hear about their first day. I find it much easier to =
tak to them earlier in the day, before they are tired and when there =
aren=E2=80=99t a lot of people talking around them. At times it was hard =
to hear what they were saying, or they were distracted. Please rrange a =
time that when I can talk to them before their getting ready for bed, or =
all them to call me. They told me that they don=E2=80=99t know how to =
use the phone, and that it can only accept incoming calls. I trust you =
will correct that belief. And as far as phone calls go I=E2=80=99ve told =
the girls I just want to say hi on a regular basis. If they want, they =
can talk my ear off. Or, if they=E2=80=99re busy, they can say hi dad, =
going to play, bye! They no there is no pressure on them to talk longer =
than they feel like it. But keeping contact is important, and I hope you =
won=E2=80=99t restrict or make that conditional, especially  under the =
current circumstances.

want to talk to them again and hear about their first day. I find it =
much easier to tak to them earlier in the day, before they are tired and =
when there aren=E2=80=99t a lot of people talking around them. At times =
it was hard to hear what they were saying, or they were distracted. =
Please rrange a time that when I can talk to them before their getting =
ready for bed, or all them to call me. They told me that they don=E2=80=99=
t know how to use the phone, and that it can only accept incoming calls. =
I trust you will correct that belief. And as far as phone calls go =
I=E2=80=99ve told the girls I just want to say hi on a regular basis. If =
they want, they can talk my ear off. Or, if they=E2=80=99re busy, they =
can say hi dad, going to play, bye! They no there is no pressure on them =
to talk longer than they feel like it. But keeping contact is important, =
and I hope you won=E2=80=99t restrict or make that conditional, =
especially&nbsp; under the current circumstances.</div><div =
