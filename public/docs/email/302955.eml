Hi Jane,

I know you are busy and may not be able to respond, but Cynthia offered =
visitation in her home (her mother as supervisor), which I am not =
comfortable with and believe is inappropriate. I responded suggesting a =
park or chapters, and she sent the email below.

I have spoken to the Aunt she mentions 3 times in the previous 5 months, =
and during the last phone conversation she lied to me and I did not know =
until now. It is clear what I meant: Cynthia=E2=80=99s step father was =
in his car for more than half the visit last Sunday, behind a hill and =
out of sight. On at least two other occasions her mother was out of =
sight of me and the girls. I could have simply walked away with them. I =
did not. I have never done such a thing. I will never do such a thing.=20=


I will not go to her house, but I don=E2=80=99t know how to respond. If =
I don=E2=80=99t hear from you I will very briefly state that I have =
never broken an agreed upon visitation, her position is unfounded, on =
three occasions I have been out of sight for extended periods, and that =
I will not subject my daughters to the drama that would ensue.=20

If you are available, please advise. I want to see the girls, but =
don=E2=80=99t want to say too much.

Darryl
