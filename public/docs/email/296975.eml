Hi Denyse,

Thank-you for listening to it, and your advice. I'm glad I got to talk to yo=
u before taking any action, and I feel less worried - while still concerned a=
bout the general sleeping arrangements. I've contacted our family doctor, an=
d will follow up with Any when she's back.=20

Best,

Darryl
