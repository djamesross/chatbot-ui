Cynthia,

Please, at least have the decency to let me know that you are going to =
provide some kind of access. I was open and honest with you, told you =
where they=E2=80=99d be, and when they=E2=80=99d be dropped off, and I =
did so. You=E2=80=99re mad, I know, but refusing to tell me anything at =
all, refusing to tell me if you=E2=80=99re going to provide any kind of =
access at all, is so little to ask. I understand you want Alison to =
provide the details, but please just let me know that much.

This so extremely difficult and hurts so much, and all I=E2=80=99m =
asking is to know that I will be able to see them. Not giving even that =
little is just a cruel punishment. If that is what this is about then =
you=E2=80=99ve done it, but I don=E2=80=99t deserve to suffer this much.
