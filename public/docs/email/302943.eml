 that will prevent her from taking my grils away again, I also need to seek=
 child support as a necessity, and I want to explore the option of parallel=
 parenting because she constantly interferes. If it is possible to seek dam=
ages for malicious intent knowing I was moving in here follpwomg our agreem=

 girls, had purchased the tickets, and the girls were so excited. She was a=
ware because she tightly control phone calls and they are always on speaker=
phone. However, the day before her mother claimed I hurt her feelings (she =
may have felt so but I did not), and so Cynthia set in place=C2=A0 a new se=
t of rules, and prevented me from a scheduled vist the following evening. I=
 was only allowed to see the girs at indigo and was not allowed to take the=
m to the movie. It was made clear the police would be called if I did, even=
 though it is next to indigo, has fewer exists and is therefore easier to m=
onitor. And her rtigger is the fear that I will take the girls, which month=
s and many opportunities have proven I will not. She doesn=E2=80=99t seem t=
o understand I will not do that to the girls and it would cement her case, =
should she bring one. Nevertheless her stepfather supervised by not paying =
any attention to where we were or what we were doing. IT was punitive direc=
ted at me but hurt the girls. I was told Charlotte was sick, but once her m=

 at length about this as you should have joint custody but she is trying to=
 change that. And you should have more access. However, there is not much y=

did before. She is controlling the show. I am surprised that you have not g=

<p class=3DMsoNormal>So you are supposed to have supervised access but the =

The order from Master Champain from Jam.2018 again orders that I &quot;shal=
l continue to have interim supervised access with the children, namely.... =
on a schedule that is mutually agreed upon by th parties and subject to a m=

y the parties or further Order of the Court.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p></div><div=

Then in June of 2018 The Honerable Kearshman accepted our agreement which d=
id not mention or ammend the earlier orders which make specific Orders abou=
t how supervisors are to be chosen and times decided on the principle of ag=
reeableness, which was agreed upon by us (even though they knew I was exper=
iencing active addiction but I know that train has passed), the order state=
s nothing more about the changes to access to mu daughters save that they s=

il further written agreement or Court Order.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p></div><div=
