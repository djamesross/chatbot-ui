Charlotte is available to speak with you after her bath. Alice is at her gra=
ndparents, spending time with her cousin and I expect they are already in be=
d.

As for tmrw, a visit outside of your home can be arranged through my parents=
. I am not available to coordinate tmrw so please arrange a visit directly t=
hrough them.=20

As for Xmas, again I am happy to arrange a visit at your house on Thursday, D=
ecember 26 th with a supervisor present once I have taken a quick look at th=
e place. I think this is a positive step in the right direction.=20

It=E2=80=99s perfectly reasonably for me to meet the family who will have ac=
cess to our children. You are in a shared living space and the family will b=
e interacting with our kids.=20

Regards

Cynthia
