Hi,

I just spoke to my mom and she is booked for dental surgery next =
Thursday (not tomorrow, but the week after). She tried to switch it but =
couldn=E2=80=99t. I don=E2=80=99t want to miss any time with the girls, =
so I=E2=80=99m hoping we can switch to Wednesday just for next week. =
Would that work?

Also, Ali was adamant about only wanting Hatchimals for her birthday, so =
I got her some.
