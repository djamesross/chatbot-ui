Thanks Any. In terms of justification, how about Cynthia's track record of k=
idnapping and removing Charlotte from school, and doing whatever she can do t=
o prevent me from spending time with the girls. I can't honestly or realisti=
cally expect her to leave them in there and allow me to pick them up. Can th=
e case focus on her lies/deceit/bad faith as an attempt to interfere with my=
 relationship with girls?
