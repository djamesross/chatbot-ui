Without Prejudice,

oK, Ali's horn is printed and I'll put it togethterh tonight. I have a
headband to hold it in p;ace.. I've got lights for CharWrist guard and I
already had lights that can go on her jacket if I can have for an
hour tomorrow night. I'll have it rady for tomorrow might.

Do they have baskets? If so, I have orange el wire that can be attached
that glows and makes it safer.

I would like to come by befor they leave to see them in their costomues and
see them off. Thanks,

By the way, I am working on Alison's letters. More to come shortly.

For tomorrow the girls get bored at Gyn Tale pretty quickly. But we could
meet there and then decided Chapters, Gym Tales, etc.?

Hi Darryl <br>
<br>
Thanks for your message. For the costumes, let=E2=80=99s keep it simple, th=
e light up horn for Ali and bracelet for Charlotte will be enough. I gave y=
ou the bracelet. Do you need the unicorn headband or do you have one?<br>
<br>
Girls will be dressing up for school so we will need the items Wednesday ni=
ght.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Halloween, Charlotte made plans with Elyse and is being picked up at=
 540. I plan to take Alice with some friends around that time. If you are c=
omfortable you can pop by quickly at 515 to see the girls in their costumes=
. Does that work?<br>
<br>
The weather is not great for tmrw. Can we plan to meet at Indigo in Barrhav=
en at 415? Or you could look into gym tales on greenbank. My mum is supervi=
sing.<br>
