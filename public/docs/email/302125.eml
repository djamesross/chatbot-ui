how I felt over the past week of events. Yes, this email was written out =
of anger--but it wasn't brief. Days have gone by and my feelings are =
still hurt and I am angry over how I was treated.
> FYI-- you could have, at the very least, called me to let me know that =
you were leaving early. A phone call is not that hard.
> =20

truths. I have personally grown to believe that life holds many truths =
or better yet realties.We can choose to see these truths head on and =
deal with them or dismiss these truths and hide.This is how we grow =
spiritually, emotionally and mentally by confronting these problems =
(which most time can be uncomfortable but necessary to grow). Anyways, I =
will leave the psychology for now.=20
> =20
> I would like to take the time to respond to some of your points and do =
so honestly and directly:
> Yes, I know you love your wife and I'm sure she loves you. Even the =
healthiest of marriages  go through difficult times and thats actually a =
time for growth  for a married couple.Marriage holds many components =
(which include love) such as trust, respect, friendship, security and =
compatibility. Frankly, I think your actions reflect that you don't =
respect your marriage. I will explain, your constant flirting is over =
the top. There's a difference between healthy flirting and come ons. I =
think you cross this line. It also gives the image to others of being a =
unhappy and unsatisfied partner. Flirting can lead to one's partner's =
feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. What you may see as "psycho" =
behaviour from an partner is simply fellings of mistrust due to their =
partner's flirtous manner.=20
> How would you feel if Michelle had a two-hour long conversation at the =
bar with her old boyfriend while you spent some holiday time visitng =
your family at the cottage? Not good eh? I don't give me that sexist =
shit that its different for guys. Marriage is an equal =
partnership.Enough said there.
> =20
> =20
> So you don't think Boxing Day, would have lead to sleeping together =
that night.I say BULLSHIT. I know perfectly well that if I had accepted =
your invitation to Mark's later, we would've been all wrapped up in our =
past feelings for another and there would have been some hot and heavy =
sex taking place. You can deny if you want but it won't change my mind. =
Whatever eh?
>=20
> So your defence is that you were curious eh?Well, those questions =
could have been asked soberly and directly anytime. We never had any =
real closure and I was open to discussing this issues honestly and =
soberly. I even brought that up at Lydias.BTW- you pressed the fidelity =
issue more than once--which is complete crap that you would still even =
question this since I've always been faithfull woth my lovers.YOU are =
the one who cheated at the beginning and at the end of our =
relationship--not I. For some reason you don't trust woman and I think =
the reason is because you can't trust yourself. I hope that changes for =
you.
> =20
> Back to your curiosity statemnt ( curiosity kills the cat didn't you =
know?). I will reiterate my oirginal email once agian. At some fuckin =
level Ryan, you knew I still had feelings for you. I had made that =
perfectly clear in some email exchanges (post Scott) and even whne I was =
pseaking to Robin over the phone. What really hurts, is that you =
advantage of this.  I'm a somewhat "broke" single mum looking to live =
back in toon so that I can expose my boys to some good old fashioned =
prairie roots. The thought of having a loving boyfirned to share this =
life with me crossed my mind--and you know that.
> You played on that vulnerablility, whether you realize it, accept it =
or not. As a friend, you should have given some thought to my current =
sittuation and showed some self discipline to not go there--especially =
intoxicated. Belive me, I've cried a few times over our abortion choice =
and the "couda, shouda,wooda sneario". that;s still painful, painful =
stuff for me and you as my "freind" should have been sensitive to =
that!!!!/its like you don;t want me to let go our past. Someone told me =
that night I was been strung along by you--which is the truth and that =
FUCKIN HURTS. I don;t thin you like any loveers to actually move on and =
I have frim expamples of this but don;t have the time to go there.
> =20
> I too thought our friendship was important but I can;t shake the fact =
your own own needs and curiosities come first.Through my sepration with =
Scott (and thank you for actually saying his name) I've leaned on many =
for support including a crying shoulder. My firneds they opened their =
ears, dried my tears and provided encouragement.
> =20
> Do you consider yourself to be that kind of friend Ryan? Instead of =
providing a listenting ear, I felt that you seemend more interested in =
finding out if I had a new boyfriend. You didn't even give me a phone =
call whne you siad you would.I found the only time you responded to my =
emails were when I deliberately flirted with you. Ouchh,
> Tell me Ryan, as my "friend", would you be open to just listening and =
providing a strong shoulder to cry on?? If I came to you in person with =
a problem with Scott.. like I'm worried he is manipulating my boys and =
making them feel guilty for not seeing him enough or that he might lose =
his job again and that im' faced with the deicsion to return to toon to =
find a good job or find something more full time here? If I was to vent =
to you about these things, would you listen and provide feedback or just =
take advantage of my vulnerablity? Your idea of friendship with women is =
somewhat different.
> Wow, this email is long but yet    I still ahve more.
> I want to address the issue that you raised about me cutting you down =
about your financial success. I do admit to burning you about it at =
/earls. I thought it might lighten the mood to poke fun at all your =
riches. I dodn[t know this was a sensitive issue or I wouldn't have done =
it. When Candace told me At Lydia's that you were hurt by my comments, I =
immediately apologized to you in person and tried to explain my actions. =
And then yet again, I apologized during our post BD phone call.During =
that conversation I distinctively remeber congratualting you on your =
success and how impressed I was on your promotions. I've actually made a =
note in our conversations to congratialte you on your determiniation and =
perservirance in your carrer. I distincltly remeber saying these things =
on several occasions including this past summer at Eau Claire and over =
the phone when I was pregant with Sam.
> I will be honest and admit that your financial success does somewhat =
intimidate me. You've told me on several occasions your salary figures =
and financial perks. It's hard for me to picture you with so much =
disposable income.
> Honestly is does boggle my mind when you tell me in quick email how =
much fun you had dropping 5 k on a weekend full of booze, strippers and =
gambling.Its hard to take when I'm scraping pennies ot get by. I'm not =
jealous, it just seems so ridiculous to spend that kind money on =
partying.
> =20
> I realize that some of these things come acroos as harsh to you but, =
well its the reality that I see.There's no pedestal involved rather a =
good dose of common sense coming your way.
> =20
> You took advantage of my feelings and situation, whether you accept =
this, apologize or dismiss it by justifying it to be harmless flirtatuos =
behaviour its up to you. Our adulthood is a series of personal choices, =
decisions which we can learn to grow and just stay the same.
> =20
> If you are a true friend you should call me and apoligze for the way =
you treated me amd relazie your actions have consequences. If you think =
thats not necessary then you Ryan are no frend of mine.
> Either way I can live with.
> =20
> Cynth
> I am absolutely shocked and very disturbed by this email, and very few =
things catch me off guard but this email certainly did.  FYI - we came =
back to Calgary sooner than we anticipated and were back in Calgary on =
the 28th.  There a few truths in life but here are a few of them:
> =20
> I love my wife and never have I cheated on her nor would I ever cheat =
on her, I had no intentions of sleeping with you that night.  I may be =
an outgoing flirt but I have been that way for as long as I can =
remember.
> =20
> I agree with you that you deserve the absolute best.  I have an =
incredible amount of respect for you and how you have responded to the =
adversity you have faced, you are an amazing woman and are blessed to =
have two great kids.   I really do believe that.
> =20
> I to, thought we were going to be friends forever and when I left =
Saskatoon that is what I thought =E2=80=93 I guess we viewed things =
differently. =20
> =20
> The disdain in your email is not justified and I do not deserve to be =
told what a horrible person I am.  Do not try to pin on me our =
discussion of any past events between us; YOU were the one who brought =
up some of the history NOT me!  The ONLY issue I brought up was fidelity =
and I wasn=E2=80=99t attacking you on that I was simply curious because =
we had been through a lot =E2=80=93 I never accused you of anything so =
give me a break =E2=80=93 it was a simple question and was driven by =
curiosity and that is it.  I was not =E2=80=9Cobsessed=E2=80=9D on how =
you look, I thought you looked great that night and I told you that =E2=80=
=93 sorry.  I am not sure why you always attack me with snide money =
remarks, instead of saying =E2=80=9CRyan, I am proud of you, you have =
worked very hard and made a lot of sacrifices to get there=E2=80=9D you =
constantly put me down =E2=80=93 I am not sure why.  I called you from =
the Sheraton to talk as friends which I thought we were =E2=80=93 sorry. =
 Throughout your entire relationship with Scott I always told you that =
if there is anything you need at all make sure you give me a call, I was =
always there for you and this is how you return that support =E2=80=93 I =
am confused.  I am shocked that you can sit on your pedestal and judge =
me and tell me how awful I am and I am =E2=80=9Cdefinitely=E2=80=9D not =
in the right place right now.  You obviously do not know me and are very =
quick to judge.  Despite how furious I am right now to receive this =
email it DOES NOT take away how much respect I have for you for being =
the strong woman that you are and the great mom you are.  You deserve =
the best and I know you will find it.  Hopefully, your email was written =
out of brief anger and does not depict how you feel about me, if it =
does, don=E2=80=99t bother writing me again because despite what you may =
thing I am a good person and would do anything for anyone including you. =

things over with me over lunch or a coffee. I, personally, wanted to =
have a honest, direct conversation with you about what transpired over =
the past week which included how I felt about you and where you stand in =
all of this.
> =20
>  I deserve to have things out in the open not some DRUNKEN =
conversation in the bar about our past relationships and possible past =
feelings for one another. I felt the topics we talked about at Lydia =
were pretty serious issues and should have been discussed soberly and =
honestly. You should have made the time to call me even before I was in =
toon. We never had much closure to our relationship and it would have =
been nice to clear the air and move on. Instead of having a good visit, =
I felt like you were just fuckin obsessed with how hot I looked.
> =20
> And what was that hungover call the next day at the Sheraton all =
about?
> =20
> I'm still  blown away and really puzzled over your flirtatious manner =
that evening. It was blatantly  obvious  that you wanted to sleep with =
me. I do admit to flirting with you in a couple email exchanges  but I =
was just testing the waters to see how you felt about me  (obviously not =
too highly).
> =20
> So really what were you thinking Ryan? That maybe we would hook up and =
sleep together that night and then what? I would fucking fly back to =
Ottawa with my TWO KIDS and you would drive home to your palace with =
your wife and then figure things out? How could you think of treating me =
like that? How could you treat your wife like that? I don't even know =
who you are anymore and I guess its not my problem.
> =20
> You know perfectly well that I still had feelings for you and you =
completely took advantage of that. Its like you still want to keep me at =
arm's length because you think I'm still hot or something. You don't =
respect my feelings or the fact that I have two great boys to think =
about. I DESERVE to be treated so much better and I honestly didn't =
expect you to take advantage of me this way.=20
> =20
> Who do you think you are Ryan?You are fucking married!! Do you know =
what it is to be a husband? Its a total turn off to have a married man =
hit on you--even one that you did care about. Honestly, I was happy for =
you when  you tied the knot and I though you were readky to throw =
yourself into a meaningful partnership. Regrettably, you have no idea =
what is to share a life with another. Its actually really sad and I feel =
sorry for Michelle.=20
> =20
> What has happened to you?Or have you always been  shallow and I was =
just too "in love" to notice?
> =20
> =20
> This past few years have been incredibly hard for me. I've been =
through emotional abuse, addiction counselling and tax fraud with Scott =
(just to name a few) and all during this time I've raised two great =
boys.I totally did not expect to be in that situation but I have no =
regrets and I've grown so much from it. My family and friends have been =
incredible support for me and I expected the same from you (who until =
now,  I considered a friend for life). Boy, was I wrong.
> =20
> If you in fact still cared for me, you would have thought long & hard  =
about my current situation  and treated things with sensitivity. Instead =
you pushed all sorts of sensitive buttons and brought up old shit about =
our fucking abortion, my fidelity (give me a break on that one), =
possibility of step fatherhood and other painful stuff.
> Ryan, I was a damn good girlfriend and there's no doubt that someday =
I'll make some lucky guy  a wonderful partner. My kids are awesome which =
is largely in part due to me. They deserve a postive role model and =
someone who will treat their mum right.
> =20
> =20
> So what is Ryan, are you happily married and you two are just going =
through a "rough patch"?... Or did you just marry the wrong girl and are =
now a miserable cheat?Whatever it is, I feel sorry for Michelle. No =
woman should be treated like that. She probably doesn't have a clue that =
you tried to get with me and I'm sure I'm not the first--- or  the last.=20=

> =20
> =20
> =20
> The shitty things is that I think you would make an amazing dad but =
you are definitely not in the right place. During my time with Scott I =
still thought of you and how close we were--- and I really missed it our =
friendship. You were my best friend Ryan and above all, I truly enjoyed =
your company. I'm absolutely crushed that you would think of treating me =
this way. If you still had feelings for me, you should have done the =
right thing and first looked at whats wrong with your marriage. If we =
would have ever made it, there would have been so many obstacles to jump =
over together. After this past week, I think you're too selfish of a guy =
to  take those risks and put others before you. Its really too bad =
because it could have been great life together.
> =20
> Anyways, I feel a bit like the character Rachel from Friends who is =
writing Ross this long twelve page letter about thier past issues so I =
think I'm just going to stop now.
