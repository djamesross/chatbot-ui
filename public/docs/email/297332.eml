Hi Lynda,

I=E2=80=99=E2=80=99ve been working with Dr. Willow at the Royal, and =
have made great progress. I am off alcohol, and she=E2=80=99s prescribed =
a medication that has really helped. We also talked about triggers, and =
strategies to avoid the underlying causes. I can explain more when we =
meet. It=E2=80=99s also helped being back at work, teaching, taking with =
colleagues, and keeping busy.

My sister and step-dad seem very sceptical about meeting with us, so =
I=E2=80=99m not sure if they will come. I hope they do, but in the end =
it=E2=80=99s up to them. Now is not a time to  manage their feelings.

I  just wanted to confirm the time we=E2=80=99re meeting. I believe it =
is 10 am, at my house, and I would invite them at 11:15 am. Is that =
right?

I hope you=E2=80=99re enjoying the weekend.

Best,

Darryl
