Hi Cynthia, that is completely unacceptable. In August I decided it was
best if I stuck to our agreement which you had arbitrarily changed. You had
been making so many changes to the schedule the girls were getting
confused  Our texts show I was accommodating as much as I could be, but it
reached a point where I thought it best that they have consistency, plus I
promised them I would take them to the beach and they wanted to go, and
it's important to keep a child's trust. You called the police
unnecessarily, according to their own words in a way the courts do not
like. And it scared the girls. In the end, the police found no cause for
concern, and I returned the girls the next day as promised.

I have always maintained to you, and promised the girls, that I will not
prevent them from seeing you or keep them for more than half the time. You
are the only parent who has twice arbitrarily and without cause, based on
false accusations, taken the children away and then been proven wrong. I am
the only parent who has cause to worry every time I leave the girls with
you, and yet I did and I will. I don't think you understand how important
it is for them developmentally to have a relationship with each of us
without interference from the other parent and that is what you are doing.
I will not do that, no matter how difficult it is and was, because it's
about the girls. Please recall I returned the girls to you in August
knowing full well that this might happen, but it was the right thing to do
for the girls. There there is no cause to doubt that I will not return the
girls as promised and work toward a cooperative shared arrangement. That is
the only long-term solution for our girls well being and best interests.

At this point you are describing a situation in which you are refusing to
let me see the girls because of your own fears that have no basis and
forcing me to agree to the restricted access schedule you are demanding.
It's your choice to continue on this path.

Darryl
