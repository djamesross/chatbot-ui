Hi Lynda,

I just got my teaching schedule for next semester, and a list of =
meetings, most of which fall on the Monday we were supposed to meet. The =
strike really messed things up.=20

However, I am available all day Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday from =
noon to 3 pm, and Friday from 2 pm on. Do any of those dates work for =
you?

Again, apologies for the late notice. It=E2=80=99s a mess at the college =
right now!

Best,

Darryl=
