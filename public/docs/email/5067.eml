Without prejudice,

The visitation you are offering is inappropriate, but now that you have adde=
d as a condition that you remain there as well it is not in the interests of=
 the girls and unacceptable.=20

I will be at the college should you be willing to reconsider and decide it i=
s in their best interest to maintain contact with me until a reasonable sche=
dule is put in place. The park is more reasonable and will not put the girls=
 in an inappropriate position and avoid tension and discomfort.=20

In addition, my mom is occupied today so I will be bussing, with all that en=
tails.=20
