Didn=E2=80=99t mean to send that. Computer is still acting up.=20

Anyhow, are you able to pick up the clothes? You also mentioned Char=E2=80=
=99s bed - I assume you mean the white one Ali sleeps in?

I think it would be easier if we could talk about this - just what =
you=E2=80=99d like or could use, and what I=E2=80=99ll store. If =
you=E2=80=99re comfortable, it would be much clearer and easier. I=E2=80=99=
m home until 4:15, and then all day tomorrow (in and out, most =
likely).er

I=E2=80=99ll take the bed apart. Char=E2=80=99s bed may not come apart, =
however, given it=E2=80=99s a used IKEA bed that=E2=80=99s been =
re-assembled multiple times. But I=E2=80=99ll try.
