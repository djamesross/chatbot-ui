>=20
> It was great hearing your voice once again!
> Thanks  for calling mum yesterday. I really hope you guys can talk =
before you leave!I just know she=C4=ABll like ya!
>=20
> So are you ready for this one??
>=20
> A couple days ago, we had a little conversation about the sex issue =
and how long it=C4=ABs been since we=C4=ABve gotten action, well more =
like when=C4=ABs there=C4=ABs been actual penetration. You guessed about =
a year for me and I said you were wrong. So you guessed sooner. Wrong =
again Monsieur Leclair.=20
>=20
> In fact, this coming New Year it will be FOUR years.
> Yikes hey?? No wonder I=C4=ABve been loving the chocolate so much =
lately...it=C4=ABs because I=C4=ABve been getting those urges once =
again!!
>=20
> As I told you on the phone, I=C4=ABve got some health problems, it =
nothing serious but it=C4=ABs prevented me from being sexually active. =
Which hasn=C4=ABt been a terrible thing because I don=C4=ABt like =
sleeping with loads of dudes (not like my in past) but it has affected =
my life in various ways. To put it bluntly, it has MUCHO sucked!! (mucho =
is much in spanish;)
>=20
> This is one of the reasons I moved to Ottawa, in order to be closer to =
some gynos that were familiar with my condition.
>=20
> About five years ago, in the summer, I had some surgery "down there". =
Somehow, the surgery triggered some sensitive nerve endings "down there" =
and made sex or any sort of penetration very painful. I don=C4=ABt want =
to get into the medical details about it so I=C4=ABll provide some links =
at the bottom of this email that further explains my condition.
>=20
> Back to the story, after that, sex with Ryan became less and less =
frequent. Until eventually that New Year, I just stopped having sex all =
together.=20
>=20
> Looking back now, I think my reasoning for giving up was because =
subconciously, I knew Ryan was not the man for me or I was just lazy!!  =
As you might guess, this affected our relationship big time, but he was =
really patient with me, even though, I didn=C4=ABt try to get help or =
have sex. That=C4=ABs one reason why I=C4=ABll always love him for his =
patience.=20
>=20
> But now with you, it=C4=ABs different,I actually really want to have =
sex again. I think it=C4=ABs because instead of just loving my partner =
I=C4=ABm IN love with him.=20
> I finally understand the difference!!
>=20
> And of course, I want to do it for myself too. you=C4=ABre just the =
icing on the cake!!
>=20
> So knowing that I have this problem, I=C4=ABve been REALLY =
apprehensive about you and I doing the deed. Especially since I=C4=ABve =
been out of practice for so long!! To be honest, even when I was in =
practice, I was pretty young so I didn=C4=ABt do much but lay there. =
Lets just say I=C4=ABm VERY familiar with the missionary position. Which =
has it=C4=ABs perks too!!!
>=20
> The good news is that I finally came across a doctor that=C4=ABs =
familiar with my condition and I=C4=ABll be seeing him in Kingston in =
the new year. So I=C4=ABm on the road to recovery.
>=20
> The other good news is for you too, from what I=C4=ABve HEARD from =
Ryan, I=C4=ABm pretty good at giving head.=20
>=20
> Hehehehe.
>=20
> I=C4=ABm really not worried about it amd I trust you completely and I =
know that=C4=ABs it=C4=ABs gonna be okay. And with a little time and =
work on my part I=C4=ABll be able to have sex regularly. I would like =
for us to give it a try in Spain but it might take some patience on both =
parts.
>=20
> While I dropping this bomb, I might as well add in another thing about =
me, even though,  I think you already picked up on this one.
>=20
> Like so many other girls, I have some real body issues to deal with. =
Meaning I=C4=ABm VERY uncomfortable with my own skin and I feel very =
uneasy about being exposed around people. So just take that in =
consideration when we=C4=ABre together. I=C4=ABm getting better but I=C4=AB=
m still not there yet.  Spain has been really good that way too.=20
> Even when I writing this note to you on the beach, I=C4=ABm very =
uncomfortable because I=C4=ABm half naked. It=C4=ABs driving me mad!!
>=20
> Luckily, my parents have  healthy body images and I only started to be =
uncomfortable, like so many other girls my age, during those tough =
puberty years. That=C4=ABs why it=C4=ABs been so great to see my sisters =
with those healthy attitudes and that they haven=C4=ABt let peer =
pressure get to them.
>=20
> Of course these are things that everyone deals with and now that I =
recognize what a problem it=C4=ABs been for me in the past, I want to =
work hard on improving myself. Which boils down to one thing, getting =
more self confidence.=20
> On another note but in the same lines of building healthy images, I =
got to start thinking about our kids.=20
> It all started a couple nights ago, after talking with Tanj, she had =
made a joke about us both being bubble kidz and that if we don=C4=ABt =
watch out we=C4=ABre gonna have bubble babies. I started thinking about =
bringing kids into the world and recognized that, if I can help it, I =
don=C4=ABt want our kids to go through the same health and emotional =
problems as I did.  But of course if our kids are sick, there=C4=ABs no =
worries there too because I know with our combined love, our kids will =
be great even if they have to live in a bubble! But if I could, I=C4=ABd =
rather avoid it.
>=20
>=20
> I don=C4=ABt know when that time is going to come to have kids and I =
think that=C4=ABs why I=C4=ABve been struggling with this damn five-year =
plan. Because at the end of my "plan" I picture us both to be in great =
health in our mind body and spirit. And I think then, we=C4=ABll both be =
in a better place to "settle down".And who knows how long that will =
take!!!
>=20
> But putting that aside, whose to say we can=C4=ABt get hitched right =
away? Well, I guess I don=C4=ABt mean right away.=20
>=20
> No vegas, even though that would be fun!!! But we=C4=ABll FOR SURE =
have to go there in one of our little travelling adventures!
>=20
> Don=C4=ABt worry though, we won=C4=ABt have to stay in a dirty hotel. =
Been there. Done that. Not too fun but us ladies had some good laughs. =
Our hotel was called the Westward Ho! Can you picture it? Good times at =
the Ho!!
>=20
> So I guess that=C4=ABs all I wanted to say to you right now, I still =
feel a little shy talking to you over the phone about all this jazz =
because it is very straight up just like you (something I admire). I =
really want to lay it all out for ya so we could have a "FRESH START"
>=20
> Some cute guy once said that to me, funny I can=C4=ABt remember his =
name....hmmm prince was it???
>=20
