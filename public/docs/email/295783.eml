Without prejudice,

Let's meet at Walter Baker park. There is a library there in case it's =
cold so we can keep warm but every-time I see the girls they just want =
to play and run around and they have lots of energy and they want to do =
stuff, so I think it's important to go somewhere where we can do that. =
This is my only time with the girls as long as you're exercising =
complete control over my relationship with them, refusing access and =
restricting my ability to parent my daughters and to have a full =
relationship with them.

Alice has been asking for seepovers with me again, and Charlotte tells =
me she misses me and our activities. This is hard on me, but I=E2=80=99m =
coping and have had lots of help to do so.

I repeat that as CAS has concluded supervision is not necessary nor have =
you raised any safety concerns. The Police officers who you called saw =
no reason to remove the girls or any sign of concern. Supervision is not =
necessary and they want to spend half their time with me. they're always =
extremely excited to see me and just want to just run, play and have =
fun, so I think we should try and find a place where we can do that. I =
know Dennis gets cold, but you are in breach of the last court order in =
terms of supervision, and it is the girls best interests that are =
fundamental here. The girls are the primary and most important concern. =
What we decide to do or what you are telling me that I have to do or =
refuse to let me see my daughters must come from the best interest of =
the girls and having them in the library telling them to be quiet when =
they're excited to see me is not in their best interest. They are =
active, we enjoy playing, and we have fun. There is no justification to =
restrict that further or to dictate where we meet.

I have some warm clothes from them that I will keep with me for the =
frequent times they are underdressed. But please make sure they are =
dressed appropriately.

Darryl
