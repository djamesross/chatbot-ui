Hi Darryl,

Unfortunately I am unable to leave early and will drop off the girls at 5
pm and pick up at 730 pm so that you can leave for your appointment. I will
text you both 5 mins away for pick up.

As for the lost 30 minutes of parenting time, I can suggest making it up
this Sunday, 2pm - 6:30 pm. Let me know if that works for you both.


See you then.

Cynthia
