Hey there,



My parents said the visit went well. I=E2=80=99m glad you had a good time w=
ith the
girls and connected with Dennis. I think it=E2=80=99s easier to have my par=
ents
supervise the visits for right now.  I spoke with Heather Clark yesterday
and she is trying to set up a meeting with you next week. I hope you can
meet with her.



Just so you know I will be changing the Child tax benefits to reflect that
I have the girls full time now. I will make this change *beginning August
1, 2017*, so that it won=E2=80=99t interfere with previous payments. I=E2=
=80=99m not sure
if you will need to contact them too but I just wanted to let you know so
we are on the same page. We can easily change it back when the access
schedule again.



I don=E2=80=99t plan to take any more summer holidays and my parents will b=
e
watching the kids. Kelly and her kids are visiting next weeks which will be
fun for all.



As you know, Alice will be starting with Roxanne in late August when
Charlotte returns to school. Alice and Charlotte are familiar with her and
Roxanne is a big fan of Alice. I=E2=80=99m hoping to get Alice into Dufferd=
oo
preschool again this year once a week. Sully might be there too.



The girls are both in dance this Fall, Charlotte in Tap, Jazz and Ballet on
Tuesdays (her request) and Alice in Ballet on Saturdays. I turned down the
offer for Charlotte to dance competitively this year. It=E2=80=99s too much
financially and timewise. There will be lots more opportunities for her to
compete in the future if she shows a keen interest



I=E2=80=99m not sure of your financial situation right now but I can assume=
 it=E2=80=99s
not great. I am asking you for help with daycare and dance. Roxanne charges
$50/day so $100 a week, $200 bi-weekly. I am asking that you can take on
half the child care costs, so similar to Laura, we would take turns paying
her bi-weekly. How does that sound?



Also, I am asking for help paying for the girls dance. I will be on a
monthly system to offset the cost, once I know more about the monthly cost
I will let you know and send you the invoice for your records. Basically, I
give them pre authorized cheques from September to May.



Let me know how this sounds.



Take care,
