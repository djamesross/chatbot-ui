I understand those expenses are hard, and a burden on you. I wish I =
could help right now, but I just don=E2=80=99t have the money. As I =
said, I have to move to a much cheaper place. If we had finalized the =
past child-support and equalization payment as I expected when I first =
set out my budget I would be in a position to help. As part of our =
discussion, we have to talk about all of our finances, which includes =
past child support and the equalization payment. I know that=E2=80=99s a =
hard a discussion, but I hope we can make it work, so I can help more. I =
want both of us to be able to financially stable, and to help the kids =
enjoy all the activities they=E2=80=99re interested in.

Finances are probably going to be the hardest thing we have to talk =
about, and I hope it gets easier from there. I really do want to work =
with you more and help more, and I think we can do it.

I would really like to talk about this with you. But there are other =
options if you=E2=80=99re not comfortable. I think the the important =
thing is that we try to keep communicating.
