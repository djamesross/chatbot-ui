Hi Cynthia,

Thank you for the response. I am aware that your position is that you =
are firmly against increasing parenting time, moving to unsupervised =
parenting time, and do not provide consent to a request for OCL =
involvement.

I am open to discussing changes to the parenting schedule to support the =
girls in soccer if the soccer schedules are shared with me in advance. =
Please note that there are limits to changing parenting time based on my =
and my mom=E2=80=99s availability.

Regarding summer plans I am open to making arrangements to move =
scheduled parenting time for 1 week of sleep away camp if advanced =
notice is provided and includes the specific dates and camp information. =
Please note that I will be making plans for activities during the summer =
so if camp is booked without first attempting to find alternate dates =
and times the girls may not be available.

At this time I am not agreeable to cancelling scheduled parenting time =
during the spring or summer so that they can be taken out of province =
for an extended and indeterminate period of time.

I would also like to request your consent to allow Amanda Telford to =
write a letter regarding her work with Charlotte. It would be limited in =
scope following Justice Smoji=E2=80=99s comments. Please let me know by =
April 19.

Thank you,

Darryl
