Hello,

It's been a week since Darryl has left ICU and I have yet to learn
anything, except that he did not have Covid-19.

Please answer the following:

How is Darryl doing?
What was Darryl exactly in the hospital for?
What are the results of his blood test?
Is he currently in detox?
 What type of treatment has been recommended?


Cynthia
