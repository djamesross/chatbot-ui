We've clearly got a misunderstanding. You suggested we start the schedule on=
 the 12th, I agreed, and week one the girls are with me for the weekend, acc=
ording to the schedule.=20

That said, we have to maintain 50-50 for the time being. That might mean we s=
tart on week 2 of the new schedule.

I'm out, but will take a look when we I get home this evening.=20

 also brings you close to a 2-2-5-5 schedule that you would do with older ch=
ildren. The benefit of this schedule is that each parent has consistent days=
 that they have the children during the week, which allows each parent to si=
gh the children up for activities that they would like to take the children t=
o.&nbsp; It also allows the parent to have consistent week days that they co=
uld sign themselves up for an activity.&nbsp; The down side is that the chil=
dren never have a Friday night with Dad or a Sunday night with Mom.&nbsp; Ho=
wever, if it is for a short period of time, I think this is something everyo=
ne could adapt to. &nbsp;</div></div></div><div class=3D""><br class=3D""></=
