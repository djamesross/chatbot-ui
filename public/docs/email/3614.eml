Hi,

Thanks for letting me know about your discomfort, and being willing to talk
about it. I'm glad that you are open to discussing these matters, because
Charlotte was very excited for me to come, and I believe it's important for
the girls to see me well and healthy, so they don't worry and feel anxiety.
I believe soccer is a great place to start. My mom planned to come, and
there are many adults there. Since it is important for the girls to have
contact with me, I propose soccer is an ideal starting point, and if you
send the location I can still make it.

Darryl
