Hi Cynthia,

I had a scheduled meeting with the girls on Sunday, and you=E2=80=99re =
just telling me know? Communication needs to go both ways. This is the =
third time you=E2=80=99ve cancelled my time with the girls, who want and =
need to see me. I would like to reconnect with them Monday after school. =
The girls need this, and it's more important than any extracurricular =
activities or other plans. As much as I appreciate FaceTime, this needs =
to be done in person.

Darryl
