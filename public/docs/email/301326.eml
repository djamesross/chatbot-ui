Hello,

I=E2=80=99m following up on the email that I sent April 11 explaining =
that I remain blocked from the parent=E2=80=99s portal and that =
technical support told me that the issue is with the school. I believe =
they may have contacted someone at the school to provide further =
information as well.

When you have a chance please confirm that you did receive my email and =
let me know if any progress has been made.

Thank you,

Darryl Ross=
