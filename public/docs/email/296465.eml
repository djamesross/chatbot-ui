I won't wait any longer. I plan to pick them up tomorrow if Cynthia isn't th=
ere.  I've thought through all the angles I can, but I can't get past the ba=
sic facts: they are my daughters, I am their primary parent, and they've bee=
n withheld from me illegally and based on lies. As long as I can avoid a sce=
ne, I will pick them up and take them home.

They said that as soon as the sexual assault issue is cleared we would discu=
ss a parenting schedule. Cynthia has lied, exaggerated, and evaded the truth=
, and I don't see an end to it.=20

I think it's a good idea to put all the pressure you can on Alison, and try t=
o get Cynthia to cave during the day. But assuming she doesn't - and I don't=
 think she will - let me know where I stand legally, and any advice that you=
 have.=20
