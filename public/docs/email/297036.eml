I got the following message from Cynthia tonight, and had to share it with y=
ou after our conversation today:

"I wanted to let you know I'm leaving for Florida on Thursday with my girlfr=
iends and get back Tuesday night.

I'm having second thoughts about being away from the girls that long specifi=
cally Alice. Anyways I was hoping I could FaceTime the girls everyday. Can y=
ou help with this? Also would you be open to giving me An extra night with t=
he girls the next Wednesday so I can reconnect a bit more? I have arranged c=
hild care with my mom the other nights.she has an iPad so we can communicate=
 easily.=20

I have been hesitant to tell you about these plans bc I am worried you will t=
ry I make me feel guilty and accuse me of being a bad mother.=E2=80=9D

How can I be surprised, right?=20

I have a question and a concern. The question: can I demand the girls stay w=
ith me on her days while she=E2=80=99s away? Or is up to her whether they st=
ay at her mom=E2=80=99s or with me?

And a concern: where is she getting the money for all of this!? I'm literall=
y about to be insolvent. I was talking to my sister and just remembered that=
 Cynthia got an inheritance of 25k when she was 25, but she never told her p=
artner at the time - the boys=E2=80=99 dad. (The reason being he was 'so ter=
rible and emotionally abusive'). They lived  together until she was about 27=
. There is reason to be suspicious she=E2=80=99s hiding money.

Let me know what you think.=20

Darryl=
