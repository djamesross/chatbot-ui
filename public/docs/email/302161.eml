ore I finally got to see the girls again, which was the longest and hardest t=
ime of my life. At times, not infrequently, I truly felt like my heart hurt.=
 In fact, I=E2=80=99m convinced that it did. And I felt pain worse than any p=
hysical trauma I have yet received. All I can I say is holy fuck that hurt. A=
nd jesus-fucking-christ I would rather suffer a compound fracture. Only a fe=
w people truly understand that I was both mother and father to my daughters,=
 but luckily my lawyer is one of them.<br>&gt;<span class=3D"Apple-converted=
-space">&nbsp;</span><br>&gt; And I worked with my lawyer (as my bill reveal=
s, hence my tight purse of late). I followed up every lead that I could (I j=
oked about billing them but am considering a career change). I went to the p=
olice station, to CHEO, and spoke to CAS. I worked up a detailed timeline, I=
 plotted her claims, versus my evidence, and cross-referenced the audio reco=
rdings. As for the authorities, Cynthia called them all. The police never fo=
llowed up, CHEO found no signs of sexual abuse (of course, but I did go and p=
ulled her record. And I found the attending nurse, who helped me decipher th=
e medical record, and sopped up my tears). Luckily, the investigator from CA=
S did her due diligence - she met with both the police and CHEO and conclude=
d that there was no reason to pursue the allegations.<br>&gt;<span class=3D"=
Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>&gt; Now, up to that point Cynthia w=
as sticking to her guns: she was =E2=80=9Conly following=E2=80=9D the invest=
igation, and asked only that we wait for the investigation to run it=E2=80=99=
s course. Only when I met with the CAS did they reveal that they never had c=
ause for concerns, beyond her accusations. (And there were so many more lies=
 too=E2=80=A6) So with that out of the way, she happily=E2=80=A6 made up new=
 excuses. Yes, she did.<br>&gt;<span class=3D"Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;<=
/span><br>&gt; But long story short, I=E2=80=99ve got the girls for now, and=
 she=E2=80=99s crumbling. But not without demanding the house, the van, chil=
d support, and everything else in the world. And you=E2=80=99ll appreciate t=
his - she wants a week-on, week-off schedule, because she=E2=80=99s now shar=
ing custody with Scott, the boys=E2=80=99 father. (And you=E2=80=99ll apprec=
iate this even more: in her affidavit she says that they=E2=80=99ve always g=
otten along well, and that he=E2=80=99s been a huge help! And yes, I have re=
ams of emails attesting otherwise).<br>&gt;<span class=3D"Apple-converted-sp=
ace">&nbsp;</span><br>&gt; My sister has suggested a title for the book of o=
ur lives - 'the last of the crazy ones.=E2=80=99 I for one would prefer that=
 Jonathan Franzen wrote it, but we=E2=80=99ll work on those issues after the=
 most pressing issues are settled.<br>&gt;<span class=3D"Apple-converted-spa=
ce">&nbsp;</span><br>&gt; I will try to make an appointment in the new year,=
 or, the courts permitting, when I=E2=80=99m better off financially.<br>&gt;=
