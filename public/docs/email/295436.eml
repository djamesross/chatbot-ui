Hi,

I wanted to up date you on my schedule, and on support payments.=20

For the fall I teach Monday & Tuesday morning 8 am - 11 am, and Friday =
11 am - 2 pm, leaving afternoons open. Let me know what works best for =
you, I=E2=80=99ll confirm with my mom, and then book my office hours =
around that.

As for support, I have to apologize for not getting to this sooner. I =
just spoke to FRO and in order for them to be involved we=E2=80=99ll =
have to wait 6-8 weeks after submitting documents. Their role is =
basically as a middle-person to mediate payments. The person I spoke to =
said that since we have agreed to payments an alternative would be for =
me to set up regular bank payments to you, through my bank: each payday =
my bank would automatically withdrawal the money and deposit it into =
your account. Which would you prefer?
