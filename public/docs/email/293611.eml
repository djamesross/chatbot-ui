Hi Alison,

I=E2=80=99m not sure if Cynthia has informed you that I have been in the =
hospital since May 2nd. Unfortunately I have been ill for some time =
before that, and unable to collect the documents requested. My condition =
has improved, and I will be leaving on the 23 of May, at which point I =
will collect all of the documents requested and send them to you.=20

I will also review the documents you attached, and seek any necessary =
advice.

It was my hope that we could come to an agreement/settlement and avoid =
going to court, now that I am well. Is that still a possibility that you =
and/or Cynthia would be willing to consider?

Best,

Darryl
