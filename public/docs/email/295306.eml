Hi Jenna,

That seems like a very low offer. I think we should counter at asking =
price to see how serious they are. If they lost their bid on the last =
house, they might be motivated to buy. We might not have the yard that =
Sunset Cove had, but then again they couldn=E2=80=99t get that house, so =
they are going to have to make some sacrifices (the yard, for example). =
I=E2=80=99m flexible on the closing date, but I think that their offer =
is unrealistic.

Darryl
