Hi Any,

Do you think it's progress? She's lied so much, could it be something else? A=
 play?

I've always thought - and my family thinks - that she didn't want the girls o=
r boys full time. But she's also very concerned about money. I honestly don'=
t know what's motivating her.=20

But if I she's genuine I am in. I asked her to talk. Should I talk one on on=
e with her (without agreeing to anything before verifying it.)

I'm still trying to get in touch with Heather (messages back and forth). I d=
o know the case isn't closed, based on what Cynthia said.=20

ANy other thoughts/ recommendations?

Darryl
