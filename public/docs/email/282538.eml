I thought about it last night and do think it better for consistency for the=
 girls and parents. I'm willing to discuss. I'd like to understand when pick=
 up would be For your Saturday weekends and pick up Sunday evenings when it'=
s my weekend. I do want to make sure that this came from Dr. Harrison. I wil=
l follow up.

I'm angry with you for the assessment and going after what little money I ha=
ve that I can provide for my four children.=20
