I wanted to let you know how their check-up went. Dr. Fraser said both =
are in good physical health. Char needed two needles, and took them =
without so much as an ouch. Ali is due at 4.=20

A few things Dr. Fraser noted or suggested:=20
Char=E2=80=99s cough is most likely seasonal allergies (when pollen is =
bad staying inside with windows closed and A/C on can help - the weather =
network posts pollen counts)
the girl=E2=80=99s should wear helmets when scootering
Ali should be switched to 1% or 2% milk (and should be limited to 500 ml =
a day), so she gets enough nutrients from other foods
as long as Ali is napping when we give her the chance, we should keep =
her napping (she=E2=80=99s sleeping 2-3 hours when here, as well as 12 =
hours a night)
Char=E2=80=99s vagina is still uncomfortable, so we should avoid bubble =
baths and soap. Baths with just water, and occasional showers with mild =
soap may help.
I=E2=80=99ll see how Char=E2=80=99s allergies and uncomfortableness go, =
and consider following-up if necessary.

Wednesday night Ali woke up several times (which she never does), and =
threw up once. After she was sick I brought her to my bed. She had the =
hiccups worse than I=E2=80=99ve ever heard, so I=E2=80=99m guessing that =
was the cause because she wasn=E2=80=99t sick again, and seemed fine =
Thursday other than being a tired. And we all shared water at soccer, =
and neither Char nor have gotten sick (or Sully).
