Subject: Re: Weekend

I=E2=80=99m so sorry you feel I used you. I=E2=80=99ve never been a social =
person. I=E2=80=99m an introvert. With friends and family I=E2=80=99ve alwa=
ys just gone with what other people plan.=C2=A0

It=E2=80=99s never been my intention to take advantage of you, or anyone, a=
nd I=E2=80=99m sorry you=E2=80=99ve had to go through this with me. I know =
you know how it feels like you=E2=80=99ve lost everything. I just couldn=E2=
=80=99t cope, I couldn=E2=80=99t escape the feelings, and I self-medicated.=
 And I know that=E2=80=99s hurt you, and the rest of the family. I can=E2=
=80=99t take any of that back, but i=E2=80=99m working hard to make it bett=
er.

I=E2=80=99m working through what is essentially a complete break-down. I wa=
s in a depression before our marriage broke down, and then I lost my family=
, and then I totally screwed up by turning to alcohol. I just haven=E2=80=
=99t had the capacity to reach out in a way people seem to want me to.=C2=
=A0

After the incident with the girls I pulled back because I was embarrassed a=
nd ashamed. Really, really ashamed. I literally did nothing from that incid=
ent to now, other than try to work through my issues, and try to get better=
. I=E2=80=99ve been completely alone, which has helped in some ways, and hu=
rt in others.

But I do need help from my family. I hoped that we could spend time togethe=
r before or after seeing the girls. I got a lot out of our conversations, a=
nd hearing about your experiences. I=E2=80=99ve gotten so much support and =
advice from you and Cindy.

As for the girls, it=E2=80=99s so important for me to have more contact wit=
h them. I need to keep our relationship and stay close to them, especially =
given their ages. Already I can feel a distance growing with Charlotte. I t=
alked to my therapist about it, and she said it=E2=80=99s vital to keep clo=
se to them, and also it will help us because you=E2=80=99ll spend time with=
 me and see and know that I=E2=80=99m sober, and getting better. And the gi=
rls will know you better too.

I will always be there for you, as much as I can be. I have just had the wo=
rst 2 years of my life, so I haven=E2=80=99t been the person I want and nee=
d to be, or the person everyone else wants me to be. But I=E2=80=99m gettin=
g better, and as I get better, I=E2=80=99ll be able to be there more and mo=
re for you.

But in the end, what I really want to say is that I=E2=80=99m glad you shar=
ed your feelings with me, and I=E2=80=99m sorry that I=E2=80=99ve made you =
feel that way.

I know I=E2=80=99ve made mistakes, but I was sincere when I said you and Ci=
ndy could stay in our house (when we had it), and I wasn=E2=80=99t comforta=
ble with you paying for me to go to Angie=E2=80=99s wedding - you=E2=80=99d=
 already given me so much, and I know I didn=E2=80=99t deserve it, and it w=
as clear I couldn=E2=80=99t pay for it myself. I can=E2=80=99t and won=E2=
=80=99t ask for more than your time and company, and a stronger relationshi=
p.

I don=E2=80=99t know where to go from here, but you have been such an impor=
tant part of my life, and I hope to hear from you, and find out what you ne=
ed from me. I will do what I can, and I will be able to do more as I get be=
tter.=C2=A0

I want to make this right. And I want to be there for you when you need it.=
 And I will be, because I=E2=80=99m getting better, and will be better, so =
I can ask less and give more.
