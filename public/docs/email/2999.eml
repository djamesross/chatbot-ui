Hi Cynthia,

I wanted to give you an update on how parenting time is going and =
discuss extending Sunday visits as first step forward. We=E2=80=99ve had =
successful visits for 3 and a half months, as of this week.

Right from the beginning both Char and Ali have been comfortable and =
enjoy their time with me. I have attached a few pictures of them from =
July, August and September. They have been asking for longer visits so =
that we can do more - Char really enjoys cooking with me, Ali has been =
teaching me all about Minecraft, and there are things that they=E2=80=99ve=
 asked to do like walk to a park and watch a movie together. And =
they=E2=80=99re always coming up with games or challenges (like bobbing =
for apples!) There a few places to explore around here as well. =
Charlotte wants to go to the fabric store as an example.

My mom has told me on several occasions how comfortable and happy they =
are, whether it=E2=80=99s cooking, playing games, or just relaxing and =
talking. In her words, it=E2=80=99s been a joy to see how happy they =
are, and how much they love and trust me. You are welcome to contact her =
if you have questions or want more details.

For this Sunday they want to carve pumpkins, as well as cook lasagna and =
do a few fun halloween science experiments. For this Sunday a few more =
hours would be enough time. They both want the extra time and have asked =
for it. I=E2=80=99m suggesting noon to 6 pm. Please let me know if that =
would work.

Separately from next Sunday I would also like to extend Sunday visits =
going forward and move to one unsupervised visit as a step forward. All =
of the visits for the last 3 months have gone perfectly well. The two =
conditions that the judge set were the girls comfort and my continued =
health. The girls are extremely comfortable, and I have been =
successfully in recovery for more than 18 months. Before we make a =
decision I will ask Dr. Bowling to provide an updated note when I see =
him later this week and send a copy to you to verify this, and for your =
records.

Please let me know about this Sunday as soon as you can so I can confirm =
with my mom. Discussing extending a visit and having one unsupervised =
visit a week can wait until I send you an updated Dr.s=E2=80=99 note and =
you=E2=80=99ve had a change to talk to the girls.

Darryl
