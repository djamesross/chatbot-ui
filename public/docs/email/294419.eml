Hi Darryl,

As I have asked you before please go through Alison with respect to access t=
o girls.

Charlotte and Alice will call you around 730pm. Just so you are aware, you a=
re mistaken in your e-mail, they begin school tomorrow.

iven those documents, and our original agreement, your support of me as a go=

king yourself further and further into an indefensible position. There are o=
ther matters too, that will be directed to your lawyer and are for her to ex=
plain to you, but for now all I will point out is under pressure and fear, I=
 agreed, to avoid court, to meet in Alison=E2=80=99s office, with just you a=
nd her/ Aliso did act like our mediator, offering, but her duty is to repres=
ent you. Furthermore, she offered to do write the final document al the file=
 it on our behalf, and you were asking for shared costs. You both knew I was=
 in financial hardship, shrugging to overcome addition, and the pressures an=
d alternatives that were explained to me seemed worse, but I had no one else=
 to provide legal advice. I was very scared at the time When the context is t=
aken into place, it becomes a potentially confusion even more serious mistak=
e, and explains why I was confused our agreement to return to joint custody w=
as not included in the document as discussed, but assumed good faith.
>=20

aintain the status quo and keep plans, the reason, where the=E2=80=99d be, a=
nd I kept my word. I am the parent who has always ket to our agreement. Up t=
a that point you have objected and wold discuss it.  Nevertheless. and fully=
 aware you would probably do this,  I dropped the girls off without any need=
 for police involvement or threats. And I did so knowing your history and fu=
lly expecting and fearing this would happen. Whether I was right or wrong, y=
ou are acting in my favour. Except that I don=E2=80=99t want the favour, and=
 wish it were not so. I want time with the girls, but more importantly they =
 want time with me, and everyone has be reporting improvements, only positiv=
e things and agree I doing much better now that I fought my own battle, and h=
ave become a present, caring and more involved parent. They don=E2=80=99t de=
serve to be put in the middle of this, and used this way. You had many optio=
ns before the most extreme, which feels like kidnaping, and I=E2=80=99ve sho=
wn no signs, expressed no intentions, or pose a flight risk. Again, this is s=
o extreme and cannot be justified.
>=20
> I understand you will not do anything before speaking to Alison, but I wan=
ted to try one more time, in hopes that some of this may get through, and so=
  that you might raise it with with her, and consider how much parental conf=
lict hurts the children, our daughters, and to let you know there is no reas=
on it has to go on. There are many other options with far less impact on Cha=
rotte and Alice, than refusing to let me see the at all add reusing a shedul=
e. It doesn=E2=80=99t have to be all or nothing, and you don=E2=80=99t have t=
o refuse to share information with me. I would encourage you to consider and=
 discuss other options, which would have made things so much easier on the g=
irls, including time at a park where you or someone else supervises, or a si=
gned agreement stating that I will return the girls at an agreed upon time, w=
hich the police could and would enforce, but which wound=E2=80=99t occur, be=
cause I would=E2=80=99t subject the girls to that.=20
>=20
> it is appearing to be a pattern,  once again reacting with the most extrem=
e choice of completely withholding the girls and giving me no information. Y=
ou could have taken whatever action you saw fit to take, with measure in pla=
ce to reassure your worries, without dramatically changing the status quo, a=
nd upending the consistency and security the girls developedk making their f=
uture uncertain.
>=20
> It=E2=80=99s worth taking time, and talking to Alison, to consider some of=
 these options, and how this affects the girls. I remain open to any means o=
f reducing this from high conflict to a disagreement we can work out togethe=
r or in court. In the meantime it simply doesn=E2=80=99t warrant such a dras=
tic change to the girls lives. For now, I=E2=80=99ll agree to pretty much  a=
nything until this is worked out, on a nonprejudicial basis, to maintain nor=
malcy for the girls, and to prevent them from wondering if and when they wil=
l suddenly be taken again. They asked me several times why you were doing th=
is, and as you said after I stopped drinking, they deserve an answer, so the=
y can understand. You insisted on the matter, and I agree that it=E2=80=99s n=
ecessary, in an age appropriate way. But I don=E2=80=99t have an answer, not=
 for completely refusing contact. Escpeciallly not Ali asked out the blue, =E2=
=80=98but why would a nice mom make me see you less?=E2=80=99 I really don=E2=
=80=99t want the to start to wonder about the =E2=80=98nice=E2=80=99 part, t=
ruly, but that=E2=80=99s what kids report feeling when parent is trying to a=
lienate the other.
>=20
> In the meantime I=E2=80=99m glad you=E2=80=99re keeping them busy. They ar=
e excited for horseback riding, school shopping, and I=E2=80=99m glad to hea=
r that Char=E2=80=99s birthday is planned for this year. She=E2=80=99s very e=
xcited, and it sounds like a very nice place to have a party. I told them I=E2=
=80=99m excited to hear how it goes, and was very supportive. But that is a s=
hort term solution that can=E2=80=99t replace their need for me in their lif=
e, and the their ability to feel secure instead of worried that you may or m=
ay not let me see them. As I mentioned above I have started to collect the r=
elevant documents, and if you refuse to follow the order for a mutually agre=
ed up schedule I will be asking Alison for her availability and filing an em=
ergency motion if access and custody is not reinstated by the following week=
end. I have retained legal counsel, add will fight for as long as it takes, w=
ithin the boundaries of the law, but will keep tat separate from the girls a=
s much as possible. I have no interests in battles or wins, and remain certa=
in that it is hurting the girls.
>=20
> You know that I will follow this through as far as possible and as long as=
 possible because of how strongly and deeply I love them, how attached we ha=
ve remained, and because I love spending time with them, and enjoy being the=
ir father. They=E2=80=99re my two favourite people. But as I=E2=80=99ve said=
 to you and to them, and continue to believe, they will do better, be more s=
ecure, and feel less concern, with two involved parents, rather than one. An=
d because we each add value to their lives, in different ways. And I will co=
ntinue to do everything I can to keep conflict between us separate from them=
, and avoid tactics loke calling the police uneccesarily. I made it clear I w=
as followig the amount of time we agreed to, and retured them without the ne=
ed for drama.
>=20
> There are other choices that can be made, which are far better for the gir=
ls. I hope you consider and discuss them. Or if you already have, it would b=
e a simple matter of letting me know, and show this isn=E2=80=99t just about=
 punishing me, or trying to hurt and break me. This has been incredibly upse=
tting, and difficult, and follows the pattens of the first, but at this poin=
t I am about as close to unbreakable as one can get. I=E2=80=99m continuing o=
n and I=E2=80=99m coping, despite how much this hurts. I=E2=80=99m preparing=
 for the move, which as you know I committed to before you told me of your p=
lan. I=E2=80=99m preparing for and looking forward to teaching. I immediatel=
y reached out for support, and am making sure that I am caring for myself th=
rough this period, which I learned to do over the past four years. I will co=
ntinue to make it clear to the girls that I=E2=80=99m strong, healthy, and l=
ook fo to seeing them soon.=20
>=20
> Aside from special plans and treats, what are you doing to ensure their co=
nfidence. The have mentioned being afraid to say certain things to you, are a=
fraid they=E2=80=99ll upset you. I trust you=E2=80=99ll do everything you ca=
n to reassure them they are safe, I am heath, and the both one the very much=
.
>=20
> Char wants to talk again after school Today, and I really want to talk to t=
hem again and hear about their first day. I find it much easier to tak to th=
em earlier in the day, before they are tired and when there aren=E2=80=99t a=
 lot of people talking around them. At times it was hard to hear what they w=
ere saying, or they were distracted. Please rrange a time that when I can ta=
lk to them before their getting ready for bed, or all them to call me. They t=
old me that they don=E2=80=99t know how to use the phone, and that it can on=
ly accept incoming calls. I trust you will correct that belief. And as far a=
s phone calls go I=E2=80=99ve told the girls I just want to say hi on a regu=
lar basis. If they want, they can talk my ear off. Or, if they=E2=80=99re bu=
sy, they can say hi dad, going to play, bye! They no there is no pressure on=
 them to talk longer than they feel like it. But keeping contact is importan=
t, and I hope you won=E2=80=99t restrict or make that conditional, especiall=
y  under the current circumstances.
