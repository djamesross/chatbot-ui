Cynthia, please kindly respond to my last email. Since I=E2=80=99ve been rel=
eased by the doctor with full health and abilities, you=E2=80=99ve cancelled=
 3 scheduled times for the girls
to see me. Since I met your only condition to meet with Krystle, and got her=
 approval to care for the girls, you=E2=80=99ve cancelled two scheduled meet=
ings. There are no reasons, including my health, the time that I was sick, o=
r money, that can continue to justify keeping the girls away from me. Krystl=
e made it clear that it is very important for the girls to reconnect with me=
, to actually see me and spend time with me, and for me to explain to them m=
y sickness. =46rom anyone else, she agreed, it will not mean as much. And wi=
thout seeing and spending time with me, they won=E2=80=99t really know I=E2=80=
=99m better.=20

This is important for our daughters. Delaying only makes this harder on them=
. It=E2=80=99s time to move forward.=20

Darryl=
