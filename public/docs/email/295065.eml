Hi Cynthia,
I'm writing to inform you that your proposed changes to our current =
custody =E2=80=98arrangement=E2=80=99 (not 'agreement') as set out in =
this email, do not meet with my approval as they are certainly not in =
the best interest of my sons.=20

I would like to understand why you have gone from suggesting and =
agreeing to a shared custody agreement, as is clearly stated in writing =
in your email to me dated December 3, 2014, to these incredibly =
restrictive terms. Especially considering how happy the boys felt about =
this new agreement when you shared this great news with them, also =
described in your own words in your email to me dated December 7, 2014.=20=


I am really concerned about your sudden and unexplained change in =
direction, it=E2=80=99s very alarming. I understand you may be feeling =
anxious, but this extreme change of heart seems a bit vindictive. The =
only victims of this type of behaviour are the children. It=E2=80=99s =
unfortunate that you cancelled our meeting earlier this week, it would =
have been nice to sit down and work through this together.

So, I will continue to call and text my sons at times of my choosing =
that are within appropriate hours and they in turn will be able to call =
and text me anytime as well. Day to day spontaneous interactions are =
essential to ensuring an ongoing, nurturing relationship for all of us, =
placing restrictions on them will only cause them stress and anxiety =E2=80=
=93 I=E2=80=99m sure you don=E2=80=99t want that for the boys. I also =
don't want this discussed with them, or discussed within their hearing; =
it will break their hearts.

Our sole focus should be Ben and Sam's physical and mental well-being =
and I sincerely hope that we can reach a reasonable agreement as two =
mature parents without having to obtain legal council and creating a =
tense and negative environment for them.


Sincerely,


Scott
