The girls have everything before me, following your sole planning. That has
been demonstrated clearly again by not starting by rescheduling piano.

Their relationship with me is treated as the least important part of their
life, and their is no justification. I'm glad you started piano again, but
there has been no consistency with that either.

It's your choice to refuse to make up time with me, and explain at some
point why you take every opportunity to limit and control their
relationship with me.

I would kindly ask you consider what is in their best interest and their
rights before making your final decision.
