Hi Darryl,=20

Cynthia has agreed to a written report and I have met with both of you =
for feedback.=20

If you want a schedule where the days of the week stay the same but you =
don=E2=80=99t want any period of time away from either parent to be too =
long, then you need to play with the weekends. =20

I can suggest:

Monday and Tuesdays always with Mother
Wednesdays and Thursdays always with Father
Friday always with mother; combined with Saturday on alternate weeks to =
make two days that the children are with her;=20
Sunday nights always with father; combined with Saturday on alternate =
weeks to make two days that the children are with him.=20

Underlined days with Mother. Bold days with Father.
2 week cycle

Monday		Tuesday	 	Wednesday	 	Thursday	 =
	Friday		Saturday		Sunday=20
Monday	 	Tuesday	 	Wednesday	 	Thursday 		=
Friday	 	Saturday	 	Sunday

This schedule gets away from the need to have a mid weekend visit with =
the other parent.
This schedule also brings you close to a 2-2-5-5 schedule that you would =
do with older children. The benefit of this schedule is that each parent =
has consistent days that they have the children during the week, which =
allows each parent to sigh the children up for activities that they =
would like to take the children to.  It also allows the parent to have =
consistent week days that they could sign themselves up for an activity. =
 The down side is that the children never have a Friday night with Dad =
or a Sunday night with Mom.  However, if it is for a short period of =
time, I think this is something everyone could adapt to. =20

What do you think?

Hi Sharon,

Can you let me know if Cynthia agreed to have the report written up?

Also, I teach one evening a week (Monday). Can you suggest a schedule =
that works well for Alice, but has a fixed day of the week?

Best,

Darryl
