Hi Denyse,

I hope you had a good holiday! I was hoping not to contact you this =
early - or at all! - but Cynthia had her first blow-up. I know it=E2=80=99=
s not the worst of the worst, but I also saw her treat her ex this way, =
and know that it=E2=80=99s only the beginning if I leave it be. So =
here=E2=80=99s the summary:

Cynthia dropped the girls off today (Sunday, Dec. 27). She came right in =
the door and immediately told me to go get their winter boots (her=E2=80=99=
s and Sam=E2=80=99s). She said, in a very rude and confrontational way, =
that they didn=E2=80=99t have winter boots, and needed them. She could =
have looked for the them during the previous five times that she came to =
the house, but chose not too. During those times, I gave her full range =
of the house, and for the first few times I left the house while she =
came. For some reason, she did not take all of the things that she =
requested or needed. Instead, she waited until the first freezing rain =
storm to come to the house, while she was dropping the girls off, to =
demand that I find the boots immediately. I said that I would go and =
look for them. She told me that she would go and get them.

She was very rude, and I (calmly) asked her not to speak to me that way =
in front of the children. I said that if she is going to be rude she can =
wait outside while I go find them. She replied, =E2=80=98uhhh, no.=E2=80=99=
 She was taking off her boots and insisting on coming into the house to =
look for them. I had already asked her not to enter the house beyond the =
foyer. (This is a woman who submitted an affidavit saying that she was =
scared of me, that i was emotionally abusive; she made a report to the =
police accusing me of emotionally abusing Ben; she refused to give me =
her new address on the grounds that she wasn=E2=80=99t comfortable =
sharing it with me - and she was ready to push her way into the house).

I told her that she is being aggressive in front of the kids, and asked =
her to stop acting that way. I told her that I looked for the boots but =
couldn=E2=80=99t find them. She told me that she would have to go down =
and find them herself.

In the meantime, I=E2=80=99m trying to say hello to my girls, and =
welcome them home - it=E2=80=99s their time with me. But Cynthia was =
insistent that I go find the boots immediately, and interrupted me while =
I was greeting the girls (I always try to take time to bring them into =
the house, make them feel comfortable - we have a routine that we do, =
but Cynthia interrupted it). She could have texted or emailed me asking =
me to find them before she arrived, but she waited until she was at the =
front door.

After stepping into the house, Sam them stepped back outside of the =
house. I asked him to come in and wait in the house while I checked for =
the boots. Before he could answer, Cynthia said that he=E2=80=99s fine =
waiting outside (on his iPod, in winter, without proper winter boots). I =
have to wonder why she brought him.

I went downstairs to look for the boots again. To be honest, under the =
circumstances, I did not want to do a thorough look for boots, when she =
could have and should have taken in the past. And the only reason I =
agreed to look at all, was because she insisted on looking herself if I =
didn=E2=80=99t. I was warned to not let her in the house without other =
adults present because she could make more accusations against me (I =
told her this). So I went downstairs, and brought the girls with me.

While I was in the basement she walked out of the foyer, to the top of =
the stairs, to make comments - about where to look, what the boots =
looked like, etc. She also walked into the mudroom and looked through =
the closet. Later, on the phone to Charlotte, she made a comment about =
the new trampoline. (I bought the girls a small indoor trampoline for =
Christmas, which Cynthia saw because she walked into the house after =
being asked not to.) I found that unsettling.

As she was leaving, I asked her not to create a confrontation in front =
of the children again. I said it wasn=E2=80=99t necessary. She replied, =
in a very angry and sarcastic way, =E2=80=98sure Darryl, it was =
ridiculous to ask for my boots, and my son=E2=80=99s winter boots, in =
this half-a-million dollar house that you=E2=80=99re in. Enjoy it!=E2=80=99=


I feel like this sounds like I=E2=80=99m just making complaints, but I =
do not feel comfortable with her entering the house. After calling me a =
pedophile, making the boys=E2=80=99 scared of me, and suggesting I tried =
to sexually assault her, I genuinely feel uncomfortable (and a little =
scared) with her in the house. Honestly, I don=E2=80=99t know what else =
she will say or do - she=E2=80=99s already done the worst!

That said, we don=E2=80=99t have a written agreement about exclusive =
possession (at least explicitly). Is there a way I can formalize it, and =
exclude her from the house? She seemed intent on pushing that boundary =
today, and knowing her, will try again. Can we send a letter, or =
formalize it in some way? I really don=E2=80=99t want any more scenes in =
front of the kids.

For the record, I sent her the following message after she left:

=E2=80=9CIt was not appropriate to speak to me so rudely, and with such =
anger, in front of the children. I'm sorry that you didn't take your =
boots on the last five trips you made to the house, and that Sam's boots =
can't be found. But blowing up at me in front of the children is not =
appropriate. You want to speak to me like that, do it when the kids =
aren't around. I can take it - they shouldn't have to. You're obviously =
upset that I'm still living in the house, but that was your choice. No =
one forced you to rent a new place.

It's clear you are intent on coming and going from the house whenever =
you want, and bringing the boys along even though they are clearly =
uncomfortable. I don't understand why you do this given how 'scared' you =
said you were of me, or your 'concerns' about my treatment of the boys. =
Clearly you are not acting in a reasonable way, and for that reason I =
ask you once again to refrain from entering the house beyond the foyer. =
If you disagree, talk to your lawyer, but don't blow up in front of the =
kids.

No matter what your feelings for me are, please think about the =
children. They've been hurt enough by your actions.=20

If you cannot contain your temper in the future, whether it's about =
shampoo, flour, or boots, we will have to communicate through our =
lawyers. It's your call.=E2=80=9D
