Hi Darryl,

I am sorry this is difficult for you. This plan is not permanent and  will
be re-evaluated at the end of the year. We never discussed or agreed for
you to be taking the girls half time in the Fall. I discussed the change in
plans with the girls this past weekend and they were happy and felt
comfortable with it.

I have discussed the proposed Fall schedule with my lawyer and discussed my
reasons for the schedule. She supports my reasoning.

I am willing to agree that you have the girls overnight on the *Wednesdays*
visit provided you are able to get them to school the next morning.

Before the girls stay overnight with you in your new place, I would like to
see the place and meet the family.

Cynthia
