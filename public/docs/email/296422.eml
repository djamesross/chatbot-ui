>=20
> This is a critical matter that deservers immediate attention given the =
impact it has on our children, as well as the worry and concern it =
clearly puts on me, and because your client is in breach of a court =
order. Ms. Holmes continues to refuse any and all access to our =
daughters, has provided no reasonable justification, and will not answer =
questions regarding the girls, including  what they have been told, if =
anything.=20
>=20
> I cannot stress how sudden and abruptly this came about, after we had =
both been actively involved in what was,  by the time, de facto joint =
custody. At no point did I question, threaten, or refuse the temporary =
order for primary residence issued by Justice Kirshman. I acted in good =
faith, following an established pattern, after Ms. Holmes made an =
arbitrary and unjustified change to our relationship, which was working =
to the benefit of the girls. I had plans made based on an agreed upon =
schedule,  and informed her that I would carry through with those plans, =
where we would be, with whom, and when I would return the girls.. As her =
counsel throughout this period, you are aware that this is indication of =
a pattern, and is not in the interests of the girls. The police saw =
nothing in the order that justified her decision to involve them, and as =
far as I know and have been told, it was with sound mind and your =
counsel that she demanded they be worken and taken out regardless of the =
fact that no safety concerns had been raised.
>=20
> This suggests strongly that she has been acting bad faith, and leading =
me, but more importantly our daughters, to believe and make plans for =
the future that are and continue to be in their best interests, and =
which they did not want stopped. They have always expected a return to =
joint custody, and as your client is on record stating early on, and =
repeating, they are happy and look forward to seeing me more often. They =
have been led to believe that they would be living with me half time, =
and this is sudden, drastic, and cause for concern.
>=20
> Throughout the period prior to CAS closing our case, your client =
insisted on moving forward only after consulting with CAS. They =
continued to recommend moving forward, and then made their position =
clear: the case is closed, there are no longer safety concerns, they do =
not recommend any restriction to access, and have left it to us to move =
forward, which your client agreed to.
>=20
> Justice Kershman=E2=80=99s order did not mention or order a change to =
the earlier order from the Honourable Master Champagne which your client =
is clearly in breach of. She had several options open to her, some of =
which I explained to her and suggested she talk to you about. There were =
many ways for her to respond to my decision that would not have involved =
our daughters in this conflict, and left them to worry about starting =
school, their friends, and other things appropriate to their ages, all =
of which would have been  less aggressive and conflictual, including =
discussing the matter with me, involving you, or bring a motion to =
court. Refusing any and all access, and attempting to alienate our =
daughters from me, is the most extreme step, and it is now the second =
time she has done so without justification.
>=20
> Both you and your client are aware of that I am in a very difficult =
financial position financially, without means to pay for representation =
and unable to qualify for legal aid. I would strongly encourage you to =
advise your client. to return to the arrangement that we had developed =
and which the girls were happy and more secure with. If she continuers =
this will not only be a complete refusal of access, but also evidence =
that she intends to alienate me from our daughters, acted in bad faith =
up to this point, and is doing so with the intent to maintain the level =
of child support we agreed would drop once I was able to provide =
suitable housing for the girls. I have done so, and her justification is =
ungrounded.
>=20
> As you may be aware, the documents pertaining to our prior =
proceedings, RT-15-2492, have been moved to storage and it will take =
time before I will receive them. Given your clients absolute refusal to =
communicate, dramatic and unjustified restriction to my access, and even =
refusal for information about the girls, I will be asking you for your =
availability as the earliest opportunity. However, knowing that conflict =
produces the worst outcomes, and because your client has demonstrated =
the ability to communicate with me, and because I have a general faith =
in the ability of people to be, at the very least, civil, I strongly =
encourage your client to immediately return the point we had achieved =
the best situation for the girls.=20
>=20
> Given all of this I have repeatedly asked your client to be =
reasonable, and provided other options to consider that would, for the =
interim, prevent harm to the girls. There is clear evidence that =
conflict between separated parents causes harm to children and should be =
prevented, and being of sound mind and with representation, your client =
chose the most extreme choices, when there were alternatives. I have =
provided alternatives and suggested she consult you on the matter given =
she refuses to communicate with me.
>=20
> My position is clear and justifiable. I have never defied or =
threatened to defy the temporary order of primary residence. I acted =
following the de facto arrangement that developed over the summer in =
cooperation your client. I informed her that we had agreed at no point =
to I indicate I would withhold the children. I explained that we had =
agreed and she had given to justification, and that I already planned =
the day with the girls. n a schedule, as evident in written =
communication,   that she then arbitrarily overruled without discussion =
or justification. We were cooperatively deciding on scheduling, and thus =
exercises de facto joint custody. Following the way our relationship had =
developed, I had reasonable grounds to believe she agreed, and she =
indicated no disagreement until the morning of the day she was to drop =
the girls off, when she informed, acting with the authority of a sole =
parent, that 3.5 days was unacceptable, so she would only et me stay =
with me for 3 days. Instead of spending the afternoon with me, she had =
arbitrarily changed our plans and treated the girls to a special =
activity that was no previously planned and out of the ordinary. I had =
already made plans believing that my daughters would in fact be with me. =
As their father, I believed it was justifable to follow through with our =
plans, and so I informed your client that I would stay with the plans in =
place, and drop the girls off as agreed on Tuesday, rather than Monday, =
as she demanded. Having represented her during the entire period, you =
are aware she is the only parent who has ever withheld access, and =
initially did so irrationally and unjustifiably for an extended period =
of time. And yet, as I have said to her and promised my daughters, I =
would not and have not ever take the girls away I informed her where =
they would be, who they would be with, and when I would return them. And =
knowing the full potential of how she might react, I followed through =
without the need for police assistance. She has reacted erratically in =
the past, and despite my suspicion she might do so again, involving you =
and the police,=20
