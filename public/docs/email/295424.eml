Hi Cynthia,

We appreciate your concern for the girls. However, please do not speak on
behalf of our family.

I also am writing this formal request to please stop contacting and
harassing our family. Immediately. And we will continue to offer you the
same respect.

You have exhausted all means and reached out to everyone and going forward
we have all agreed that communication will go directly through me. I will
respond and be the person that represents our family going forward.

Darryl has a large support network behind him, and his entire family are
here to help *him*. His family is in constant contact with him, and Kevin
and I were just there discussing your accusations with him. We also had the
opportunity to meet Heather - the CAS worker - as she stopped by while we
were there.

You have made your concerns very clear, and right now, as long as you
continue to deny access, this is going to be a matter for the legal system.

In the future, please direct all correspondence and/or concerns, through
me. The rest of the family will no longer respond to you.

Angie
