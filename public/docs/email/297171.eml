Hi Any,

Gordon Doulgas referred you to me. I left a couple of messages, and =
I=E2=80=99m hoping you can get in contact with me as soon as possible.=20=


My wife and I are going through a separation, and yesterday she removed =
the children from the house and is refusing to return them. This is a =
mess.

As background - I do and have done most of the child care (school, =
etc.), I am the primary parent for the girls and their main attachment, =
a family counsellor strongly advised her against removing the children =
(she removed my step-sons Thursday night, which the family therapist =
said was a mistake, and my wife agreed during the meeting). She is =
claiming that she is scared of me and scared for the children, and I=E2=80=
=99m seeing a pattern in her past relationships (I=E2=80=99m the new =
villain). She has made claims that I have been extremely angry and =
scared her - but she didn=E2=80=99t know at the time that I was =
recording those conversations and have shared them with a therapist who =
believes she is not psychologically healthy. I have lots of recordings.

She agreed with me and the family therapist not to remove the children =
from the house on Friday. She took them to see their cousins Saturday =
morning, and then told me Saturday afternoon that she would not let me =
see them.

I don=E2=80=99t believe my girls are in immediate physical harm, but I =
do believe that they are not being taken care of emotionally, and that =
this is traumatic to them (they are 4 and 21 months).=20

I really need help to get an emergency motion of some sort to get the =
girls back in the home, in their routine and school. Their mother told =
me recently that she is depressed, she=E2=80=99s lost a lot of weight, =
and is extremely stressed.

I really need some advice!

I can be reached at 613-762-2067

If you aren=E2=80=99t taking on clients, can you recommend any family =
lawyers who might be?

Thanks,
Darryl Ross=
