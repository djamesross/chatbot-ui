Without Prejudice,

Unfortunately your client continues to impose restrictions warranted only
by immediate safety concerns for which none have been made  It is clear she
will not take the girls inteests into account. To prevent a repetion of
last week, when the girls were very upset Dennis abruptly cut out our visit
short because Ms Holmes failed to communicate with Mr. Morison. All parties
are aware this is not due to concern for the girls safety save your
client,  which is why his hobbies and her mother's choir practice are far
more important than the girls being able to have a relationship with their
father. Bit I'm actually trying to preempt further evidence that of intent
to alienate and them claim status quo, while keeping the girls from me
without cause.

Final marks, as part of my job, are due shortly, so I will be at the
college tomottorw. I'm not going to do anything to provoke her to call the
police unnecessarily, but Ms. Holmes never gave a reason why they can't
meet me there. It was a some no. I would appreciate an explanation given
it's large, they can be loud and play, I have an office we can store our
stuff in, play, and color, walk around, and unlike McDonald's have quity
time. Not to mention that I made plans weeks ago to bring them back to the
Maker Space there at the College where I have access, it behooves me to
exain why giving the girls the rare opportunity of learning about 3d
printers, getting to design something that I can print out on the laser
cutter (fully safety qualified!), as well as make Christmas cards with the
Silhouette Cameo. (Plus get to experience VR, interesting people pursuing
goals that our government is investing in, and have fun while her parents
have plenty of comfortable places to read.

She has mentioned her parent's age and limitations, and made clear her
parent's interests are primary, for which there are comfortable chairs,
couches, food and coffee, room to walk around.

And I needn't remind you that your client has an extreme fear that I will
take the girls away from her, yet she is the only parent to have done so
twice without cause. Yes, there was a time at which point it was necessary,
but I did so cooperatively, met all of her demands and expectations,
woredk with CAS cooperatively, to ensure the girls know I am healthy, only
to repeat the pattern. It will have to be raised as a legitimate question
as to why she suddenly recently informed the girls that I am sick and I
can't take care of them when she has made it a point not to see me and
relies on hearsay. As my medical records will show I am more than fit to
take care of them certainly more fit than the parents that she has chosen
as supervisors who she says have limitations on their abilities

Furthermore, your client should be made aware that she has made it a point
of avoiding me since August, and has made no effort to interact with me as
a concerned parent would and is actively working against the princincple of
maximm contact (forgive the inccorrect legal term).

It's becoming more common to ask children, even at a young age but they
would like to do I propose that she do that tomorrow. That would at least
show some good will toward the girls if not toward me because in this my
interests aren't what's at stake. She has strictly forbidden us to meet
anywhere other than a library which the girls are never interested in
because they're so excited to see me and want to play or Indigo which is
fine to visit but to repeatedly go to a toy store it's not ideal as I'm
sure you'll agree.  Except when she makes exceptions.

Anyhow I was looking forward to hearing back from you this week and
unfortunately I didn't, as is the pattern, so I hope to hear back before
tomorrow so that the girls aren't left wondering when they will see me for
how long they will see me and if they will see me somewhere new or
different or interesting or exciting somewhere we can spend some quality
time together until this is corrected.  I'm available anytime between about
2 p.m. and 5 p.m. if your client again refuses to allow the girls to meet
me at the college then I would ask that she give some notice because I will
have to travel and make arrangements and I can't do that last minute, that
it's reasonable we don't meet at a toy store every time and that the girls
with what little time they have with me aren't interested in sitting and
reading books during that time.

As always I am absolutely opposed to supervision as there's no need for it
it is an imposition and a clear attempt to control the way that my
relationship develops with the girls which is important to their
development.

Darryl
