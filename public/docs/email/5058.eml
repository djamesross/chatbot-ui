Meeting with Darryl and Cynthia.
Charlotte and Alice absent as they have head lice.
Purpose:
To discuss updates on visits, worries/concerns, safety plan, recommendation=
s, and status of file.
Visits:
Visits have been going well. The girls have reported that they are happy an=
d have been asking when they can have more visits with their dad.
It has been observed by all parties that the girls appear more comfortable =
and Cynthia informed that she sees that Darryl has been doing well since Ja=
n being reliable and consistent.
Darryl would like to  increase visits to have more times with the girls and=
 wants to have sleepovers.
Cynthia informs that she never has an issue of how the girls are doing whil=
e with Darryl and praised him as being a great father of the girls but is w=
orried about how he is dealing with other aspects of his life that would be=
nefit in the care of the girls i.e. treatment, social life/family support, =
finances and consistency with routines.
Worries/Treatment/Recommendation:
Darryl informs he has been doing really good, he has not drank or had the u=
rge to drink.
Cynthia would like to see Darryl healthy. She expressed she is concerned ab=
out treatment and Darryl not seeing an addictions counsellor.
Darryl informed that he has not seeing Julie as she is a crisis counsellor =
and deals with people who are in crisis. But they have come up together a p=
lan on different strategies to help with keepin him on track.  Darryl state=
s that he were to have an urge to drink or relapse he would notify Dr. Will=
ows and Julie right away and would check himself into a hospital.
Darryl informed that he has been getting regular blood work with Dr. Fraser=
 to ensure his blood levels are where they are suppose be and free of alcoh=
ol. Darryl also informed he is not taking medication some of the medication=
s he was taking before such as Gebapentin.
We discussed the concern of how serious WKS was when he was hospitalized an=
d Cynthia expressed how scary that was to not know what was going on and wh=
at to tell the girls. We also discussed a more structured treatment program=
 a highly recommending this avenue. However, Darryl believes these types of=
 programs do not work for him and does not believe it is well suited for wh=
ere he is at in his addictions. Darryl spoke about his addictions coming la=
ter in life for him and was not a result of past historical issues or traum=
a. We discussed the correlation to his alcohol use to life and environmenta=
l stressors  (finances, depression, anxiety), but Darryl does believe it is=
 not one things over another.
Darryl states that Dr. Fraser has referred him to a CBT program. He beleive=
s this program fits with what he believes and will address everything in ge=
neral in order to help change his thought process as well as help with deve=
loping skills and strategies to enhance his over well-being.
Cynthia expressed she would like to Darryl to contact Dr. Willows and infor=
m her of this CBT program to get her perspective on it and to see if there =
would be somethings she feels would be more beneficial for him. Darryl agre=
ed to call Dr. Willows to see if he can get an appointment with her to get =
her perspective and will update Cynthia about this as well as how he is doi=
ng and what he has been working on, on a regular basis.
Darryl expressed that in order for Cynthia to see improvements and gain her=
 trusts is for both of them to communicate more with one another, have more=
 conversations, pop in when the girls are there with him.
Social:
Cynthia expressed she needs to see Darryl be more social, to have positive =
people in his life that can offer support as well as hold him accountable f=
or his actions.
Darryl informs that he is an introvert by nature but is working on being mo=
re social. Darryl states he has joined a cycling club, going for walks, oth=
er hobbies, and spending more time with his mom Holly, Kelly (who is met at=
 the RO), work colleagues, Aunt Buddy, Jennifer. He is also working on reso=
lving relationships with family members.
 Darryl expressed wanting to be more involved with everything with the girl=
s and their school. It was discussed and agreed by both parents that this c=
ould start to resume as of September.
Safety Plan:
Darryl indicated that although this would not happen but if he had a drink =
while the girls were with him,  he would  notify Cynthia or her mother righ=
t away and use the phrase "He is sick and cannot have the girls right now" =
which would be the code to he is not doing well or he has had a relapse.
Darryl offered using a child care person who live across the street who cou=
ld also assistance if the girls needed to go to a safe place in case someon=
e in the safety network was not available to come right away. Darry and Cyn=
thia agreed they would work out something together to have an additional pl=
an.
We discussed that the Society no longer has any protection concerns because=
 it has been a period of almost 6 months and things have been going well. W=
e discussed using the safety network of support when needed (Cynthia, her m=
other, his mom). We discussed that the visits no longer had to be supervise=
d and sleepovers can start to be implemented. Cynthia and Darryl were direc=
ted to work these schedules out on there own.
We also discussed doing a check in  before the girls get dropped off to ens=
ure Darryl is in a good state and sober. Informed that it was their respons=
ibility as parents to act protectively of their children if they feel that =
the children at any given time would be at risks by either parent.
Status of file:
Informed parents as there are currently no protection concerns the file wil=
l close. Both parents agreed with this plan. We will close the file the end=
 of July 2019.

Let me know if I have missed or need clarification on anything.
