Tried sending this to another address, but it didn=E2=80=99t work. Here =
goes again:

Lice.=20
They are not nice, smaller even than rice, and have cost quite a price.=20=

While there is lots of advice, it is often imprecise, aimed at =
merchandise which they overprice.
The question is, just exactly how to excise, these smaller than rice not =
nice lice.

(Creative morning, excuse the rhyme.)

Here=E2=80=99s some info I gathered from a few provincial/regional =
health agencies, the CDC, etc.. All evidence-based.=20

First, they all say misdiagnoses is common, even and especially among =
trained nurses. I=E2=80=99m sure you=E2=80=99re as close to an expert as =
anyone by now, but every document starts with confirmation:=20
Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. The diagnosis of head =
lice infestation is best made by finding a live nymph or adult louse on =
the scalp or hair of a person.

Because adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid =
light, they may be difficult to find. Use of a fine-toothed louse comb =
may facilitate identification of live lice.

If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits attached firmly within =C2=BC =
inch of the base of hair shafts suggests, but does not confirm, the =
person is infested. Nits frequently are seen on hair behind the ears and =
near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than =C2=BC inch =
from the base of the hair shaft are almost always non-viable (hatched or =
dead). Head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, although =
use of a magnifying lens may be necessary to find crawling lice or to =
identify a developing nymph inside a viable nit. Nits are often confused =
with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray =
droplets, and dirt particles.

If no nymphs or adults are seen, and the only nits found are more than =
=C2=BC inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and no =
longer active =E2=80=94 and does not need to be treated.


Next, common errors. I know I haven=E2=80=99t followed this exactly (I =
used it with wet hair, probably not enough, and there may have been =
conditioner in their hair):
The most common errors with using the treatments include:

=EF=82=B7  The hair had conditioner or a hair product in it before =
treatment was started. As conditioner and other products can coat the =
hair, they can make the treatments less effective if they are not washed =
off first.

=EF=82=B7  Applying the treatment to wet hair: Applying the product to =
wet hair dilutes the chemicals in the treatment. When exposed to water, =
head lice close their breathing holes which also make it harder for the =
chemicals to penetrate and kill the lice.

=EF=82=B7  Not using enough treatment to thoroughly cover all the hair: =
Thick and long hair will require more head lice product. Make sure you =
use enough head lice treatment to thoroughly wet all hair =E2=80=93 =
especially behind the neck and ears. One way to make sure that you have =
covered all the hair is to comb the product through the hair with a =
regular comb.

=EF=82=B7  Not leaving the treatment on long enough: Chemicals in the =
treatment take time to work. Make sure you follow the product =
instructions.=20

=EF=82=B7  Not applying the second treatment 7-10 days later: With =
option A and C you need to use the treatment again 7-10 days after the =
first treatment. This is because no product kills 100% of eggs and eggs =
take 7-10 days to hatch. Therefore, re-treatment in 7-10 days is a =
mandatory part of treatment.=20

>> If a few live lice are still found 8=E2=80=9312 hours after =
treatment, but are moving more slowly than before, do not retreat. The =
medicine may take longer to kill all the lice. Comb dead and any =
remaining live lice out of the hair using a fine=E2=80=93toothed nit =
comb.


The CDC is much stricter than the 24 hour period for lice, which is =
commonly found. They recommend:

...hats, scarves, pillow cases, bedding, clothing, and towels worn or =
used by the infested person in the 2-day period just before treatment is =
started can be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot air =
cycles because lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to =
temperatures greater than 53.5=C2=B0C (128.3=C2=B0F). Items that cannot =
be laundered may be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two =
weeks. Items such as hats, grooming aids, and towels that come in =
contact with the hair of an infested person should not be shared. =
Vacuuming furniture and floors can remove an infested person=E2=80=99s =
hairs that might have viable nits attached.

Conditioner must be avoided, for whatever reason:

Do not use a combination shampoo/conditioner, or conditioner before =
using lice medicine. Do not re=E2=80=93wash the hair for 1=E2=80=932 =
days after the lice medicine is removed.

Treatments shouldn=E2=80=99t be mixed, that is different shampoos or =
medications. But all can be used with combing. We=E2=80=99ve been used =
Nix, and maybe not properly. All of the treatments we=E2=80=99ve talked =
about kill lice when properly used, but not eggs. The only ovoidal (egg) =
medications are Spinosad, a first-line treatment, then Lindane, which =
can have some nasty side effects and is a neurotoxic so not my first =
choice, and then Isopropyl Myristate.. They effectively kill live lice =
AND eggs, and do not require combing. I have a feeling this may be what =
lice clinics use. They=E2=80=99re prescription in the U.S, but. I=E2=80=99=
ll ask the pharmacist today about the status here. I could take them to =
Dr. Fraser if they require a prescription, or try to buy it on the =
internet. They=E2=80=99re safe for people 6 months and older.

Balancing evidence, toxicity, patient-response (otherwise known as our =
kids willingness to take the treatment), and the fact that we don=E2=80=99=
t have to worry about the effects on a fetus (phew!), I think Isopropyl =
Myristate (ISM) might the best. Here=E2=80=99s a gov document that =
summarizes and recommends it =
http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/drugs/ced/pdf/resultz.pdf =
<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/drugs/ced/pdf/resultz.pdf>

IF that doesn=E2=80=99t work, then maybe a lice clinic like =
https://www.nithunters.com/lice-treatment.html =
<https://www.nithunters.com/lice-treatment.html> is the final step. They =
do offer a money back guarantee.

So today I=E2=80=99ll find out about ISM. Let me know if you think we =
should try it. Depending on when they were last treated (my house, =
Saturday?), I could do the first treatment today or Friday.=20

The instructions are as follows:

Use a towel to prevent contact with eyes and to keep clothes dry
Keep eyes closed throughout process, including the 10-min wait time
Thoroughly apply to dry hair and scalp
30=E2=80=9360 mL for short hair, 60=E2=80=9390 mL for shoulder-length =
hair, 90=E2=80=93120 mL for long hair
Keep product on hair and scalp for 10 min
Rinse off with warm water
Repeat in 7 days
May cause local irritation
Not recommended for use on infants or children <4 years of age
If contact with eyes occurs, flush well with water immediately

Let me know what you think. If we use ISM, because of the eye=E2=80=99s =
closed requirement, swimming googles might be helpful. If we need a =
prescription treatment I can take them to Dr. Fraser, maybe Friday, or =
early next week.

Also, I need a couple pjs for the girls, maybe 1 pair for Char, and for =
Ali. Ali also needs shorts, a pair or two.

Hope that wasn=E2=80=99t too much information, but there is a lot out =
there. (Advice and lice, to be precise.)

Also, should I use this email address during the day, and gmail/text =
other times? Or only use this address when necessary?
