Hey,

Just wanted to check in since we didn=E2=80=99t make a plan for this =
week. The girls had lots of energy yesterday, but it seems to have hit =
them today, they both slept longer and are a little tired. I=E2=80=99ve =
been getting them down earlier each night though. They=E2=80=99re =
painting right now, then we=E2=80=99re going to go to the dollar store =
to get some craft stuff. They each want to build a house out of wood =
sticks.

Have you thought about a schedule this week? I=E2=80=99m really enjoying =
the catch up time after last week. Would pick up tomorrow work for you? =
And then we can figure out the rest of the week and weekend?=20

I haven=E2=80=99t seen any eggs, but will pick up the shampoo and do a =
second treatment.
