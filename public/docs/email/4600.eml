Hi Cynthia

I've been wanting to contact to you for awhile...
First of all to reassure you that at no time in all these months has there
been any problems that Darryl has not been able to handle himself.
Its been great - and the girls clearly trust him and feel secure and loved.
They cook,  create, play and work on school work and always learning
something new !
Wow they are growing up so fast . Right?

I have felt for some time now that I really do not need to be there.
Dont get me wrong...I love being with the girls - they are truly special.
And I will continue to visit.
But supervision just isnt required.
As for me ....I have always kept up the supervision schedule so you would
feel more comfortable, even though Darryl is going into his second year of
documented sobriety.

I have gladly cancelled or rescheduled events in our life here to make this
happen.  This was an important step for you, Darryl and the girls.

However I drive a long way, as you know, to make this happen and with
winter here the roads are becoming less safe.

So perhaps its time we let Darryl and the girls have some independance.

The girls are older now and  always have contact with you by phone and
internet.

I hope you will agree its time.
