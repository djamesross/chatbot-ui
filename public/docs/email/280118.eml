Hi Darryl,

Since I extended the time beginning  Nov. 20th by two hours on Sundays from
a 4-hour visit to six hours,  I don't agree to make up more time with Alice
as she already visited you for 4.5 hours this past Saturday to make up for
the time she was sick at home on Sunday, December 4th.

I don't agree to make up time for this past Sunday December 11th as that
was your mom's responsibility to be there for the supervised time.
Additionally you advised me at 11:28 am that morning she would be late and
we delivered the girls when your mom arrived at 2:35 pm.



Cynthia
