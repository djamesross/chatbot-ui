Cynthia,

I understand that you have been depressed, stressed, and struggling in =
our relationship recently. However, the girls should never have been =
taken from our home, or from me. There is no basis for your actions. I =
have a right to see them, and I would like to pick them up from school  =
tomorrow and keep them for the night. While they are at school tomorrow =
we can discuss a temporary schedule for visitation.

You can let me know what you need for the night and for tomorrow and I =
will pack it for you and leave it inside or outside of the house. I will =
also pack a bag for the girls, and include anything the boys need. =
However, it is not acceptable to remove any additional belongings.

My lawyer has made it clear to me that you are not acting legally, and =
she will be in contact tomorrow. If  you don't return the girls we will =
be initiating a movement with the court. If you would like to speak to =
her sooner I can provider her number.

Once you have told me what you need I will pack it and leave it in a =
convenient spot.=20

Darryl
