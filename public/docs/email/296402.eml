> Hi Darryl,
>=20

morning.
>=20
> Justice Kershman has signed our Temporary Order pursuant to the =
Minutes of Settlement. However, he was unsure if all of the pertinent =
documents were in the court file to issue (i.e. stamp) and sign the =
Divorce Order so he did not sign it. Therefore, I will have one of my =
colleagues check the court file tomorrow and send you a copy of the =
temporary order and the divorce order once I receive same.
>=20
> Justice Kershman did require a timeline of when you would provide the =
remainder of the disclosure required. Therefore, he has ordered that you =
need to provide the outstanding documentation by July 13, 2018 (i.e. 30 =
days from today).
>=20
> Please do not hesitate to contact me in writing should you have any =
further questions.
