Cynthia,

We have yet to decide - we=92ll let you know.=20

I DID NOT tell Sam the medication will keep him up at night ! i just =
find it odd/funny that you guys like the medication route so very much - =
an upper in the day and a downer at night. The only thing I asked them =
is why they can sleep so well at our place and go to bed with out =
anything and go right to sleep ? and I would ask why you are following =
the same program with Sam as you did with Ben only to find out that the =
adderall isn=92t working.
