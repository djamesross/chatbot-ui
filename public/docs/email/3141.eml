Yes, they're back from Church by noon and said they'd be here. As we
discussed they're happy to meet you and think it's good for the girls, and
so do I. hey want no part of our history or drama, and I think we can both
understand that it's their home and they have children. They're very
friendly and you'll find them nice. I'm really looking forward to time with
the girls tomorrow and continuing to move forward.

Hi Darryl,

I wanted to set up a visit with the girls on Sunday and would like to meet
the parents you are staying with.

Would a visit from 1- 4 work? Can you arrange for them to be there at 1 ?

Thanks,
Cynthia
