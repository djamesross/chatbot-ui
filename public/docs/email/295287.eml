Hi Cynthia,

Thank you for letting me know and keeping me up to date but your email =
is vague and unclear about what happened and when.=20

Approximately what time did she hit head at soccer this morning?
Who was responsible for picking her up?=20
What time did they notify you?
What time did you bring her to CHEO?

This is the first time you have told me about soccer camp: what soccer =
camp is it, and where?

Please provide answers as soon as possible so I can understand what =
happened to Charlotte and how serious her accident was.

Darryl
