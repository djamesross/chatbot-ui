Hi Any,=20

I teach today from 1 pm to 5:530 pm.=20

Can you chat at 12:30?=20

I replied to Cynthia=92s message and said it was unreasonable - I would =
be present, and we=92d have to split the remaining items. She agreed to =
have a mover booked for tomorrow morning. But this morning I get the =
following message:

I haven't booked movers until the other items are resolved and that I =
can walk through my home and go through my things. I've made my lawyer =
aware of the situation as well.

That was the boys home and they have every right to be able to take a =
walk though of their home. Have a heart Darryl.

Presently you bought the girls an indoor trampoline and a giant =
dollhouse--why do you need the other things so badly?? I've lost the =
lights in the sale of the home, which were of great value.I bought the =
trampoline for my father's property, the playhouse I bought for the =
cousins to play in. I'll be taking those.=20

I have four children almost full time and will be in a bigger place, =
have the decency to give me what we need to make the home enjoyable.=20
