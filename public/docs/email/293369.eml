Hi Darryl,

Unfortunately, we will have to postpone until Thursday as Alice is still
under the weather, her muscles are sore, no fever but a headache. She has
been resting in my bed all morning. I will test for Covid again today and
let you know the results.

Can we tentatively schedule Thursday 5-8 pm and move FT to 5 pm today?

Thanks.
Cynthia
