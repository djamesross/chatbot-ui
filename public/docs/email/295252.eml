I had no intention of putting you off and was genuine in intent, but after r=
eviewing the document, noting that we have a joint custody agreement that is=
 still binding, receiving legal advice, and taking CAS and the status quo in=
to account, this is not the straightforward situation you presented it as.=20=


At every point we agreed that the goal was to return to 50-50 access. The co=
urt order mentions no schedule for the police to enforce, but our custody ag=
reement does, and we have established a de facto schedule. =20

I have made you aware of where they are, will be, and when you can pick them=
 up. They are with me now, happy, and want to remain with me until tomorrow.=
 I have to act in their best interest, which includes dropping them off tomo=
rrow, and hope you don=E2=80=99t see the this disagreement as justification t=
o involve the police and really cause the girls worry and anxiety.=20
