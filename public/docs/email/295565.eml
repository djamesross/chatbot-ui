Hi Cynthia,

If you don't want me on your property please do not invite me on your
property. I will contact Allison, actually, it's easier to cc her, who
will contact you for instructions on how to make a simple
exchange difficult, as you wish.

I genuinely thought we were making progress but can see clearly that you
have been unwilling to compromise, make alternative plans, or do anything
but make this difficult this entire time. I don't know why you want
to choose conflict, but I don't, and I will not give up on my daughters.

One last question that deserves to be given serious thought: is this for
the girls, or for you?

Underdure duress and with the belief this further foils the girls best
interests, I will wait to hear from Alison.

Darryl
