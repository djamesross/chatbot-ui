Hi babe,

I just spoke to the lawyer again. She repeated that we're on firm =
ground, and that he has very few options.=20

Her major piece of advice: deescalate this and leave me out of it, =
except to support you. She said to make it clear to him that this was =
your decision in the end. If it played out in court, the case would be =
made that you have de facto custody and are acting in Ben's best =
interest.=20

She said that we don't have an obligation to respond to his demands, but =
it's a good idea to keep him informed.

I'll tell you more tonight.
