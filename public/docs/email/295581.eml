Hi Cynthia,

I understand your hesitation. We have a beautiful weekend, and under duress
and because I want to see my daughters and they need to see me, I=E2=80=99m
suggesting you, supervisor. There would be several advantages, and I will
reiterate them with your lawyer. They include but are not limited to
reducing the conflict experienced by the girls by ostracizing me. It=E2=80=
=99s no
secret that silent treatment is a form of emotional abuse. Next, avoiding
me prevents you from seeing that I am healthy and sober, and that is
something you raise frequently. There is no better way to build trust than
for you to see me, even from a distance and with a minimal conversation if
that=E2=80=99s a more comfortable distance, we can set boundaries we are bo=
th
comfortable with, you can be near or far but always in sight, it will be a
public park, and I even have one of this screeching alarm for my bike you
can hold. Just pull the pin and the neighbourhood will hear. I=E2=80=99m op=
en to
other options too.


Alice was confused about why you would drop her present off but she could
come and see her dad, This sort of confusion has happened before, for both
Alice and Charlotte. Again, I ask that you agree to have an initial
assessment with a psychologist, We agreed to it in the past for the boys
and girls, without hesitation.

As for other supervisors, no one I=E2=80=99ve spoken to is willing to be
interrogated or involved in our disagreement as parents. They will not
provide a CV or accept being questioned and have said no because they do
not want to be involved in your complaints or accusations. That is for a
professional, who I have urged us to see. Of course, a polite greeting is
fine and reasonable.

Note for the record: I have followed the recommendations laid out by
justice Canada including trying to talk to you, suggesting myriad ways of
avoiding court. I accept you have concerns, and they feel real to you. I am
open to working through them, but if you refuse to communicate with me, I
will be forced to move to step two.

I realize the situation. What I am asking for is visitation three times a
week, with a gradual build-up as things go well. I do not expect shared
custody tomorrow, and we may end up agreeing to a different form of access.
I am open and willing to compromise,

I urge you to discuss the matter with your lawyer because as long as we are
communicating we are in control. Going to course leaves years of our life
up to a judge that will barely know us, and may not even meet the girls.


Sincerely,

Darryl
