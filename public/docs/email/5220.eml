Hi,

I wanted to confirm times for tomorrow, and also talk about extending =
Sunday visits. I=E2=80=99ve been having a great time with the girls and =
would really like to see them more. Also, I would like to start to do =
more routine things with them, like meals  and bath, etc. I spoke to =
Krystle about it, and she suggested a natural progression would be to =
make Sunday visits all day, as a step toward 50-50 residence. Would =
extending Sunday work for you?
