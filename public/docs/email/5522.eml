Cynthia,



With all due respect in case you were not aware CAS made home visits on
several occasions and never met Riva or Sophia, nor did they ask to. None
of the case workers went upstairs or downstairs. They wanted to see my room
and the areas the girls would be. The concern was the safety of the girls,
and if it was an appropriate place for children to live.



You committed to working with them and returning to shared custody when
they deemed it appropriate. And we did. And you never met Riva, nor asked
to, nor showed concern to.



Then for a second time, you took Charlotte and Alice and refused to let
them see me for an extended period of time, which has caused them distress,
and have continued to make unjustified restrictions on access and recently
made further restrictions on where and when I can see my daughters. You
provided one excuse after another to refuse to allow me to see them. Each
will be noted. Your lawyer finally explained the precise reasons for
withholding access, which do not justify your actions, but which I am
actively cooperating with in good faith. This will also be noted.



Today, a new reason to continue to restrict and control my relationship
with the girls has been made, just as we were coming close to settling the
excuses provided. This will also be noted. As the parent that has twice
taken the girls away from me and refused to return them for extended
periods of time, what will amount to months, you are claiming that your
reason is that I will not return them.



Furthermore, you state clearly that you will continue to refuse access to
my daughters "unless [I] change [my] mind and agree to [your] terms." Might
I remind you that your lawyer wrote to me on 21 August 2019 that =E2=80=9CD=
uring
your email exchange yesterday with Ms. Holmes, you stated that you refused
to return the children to her care until Ms. Holmes gave in and agreed to
your demands for a revised access schedule.=E2=80=9D Notwithstanding that I=
 never
wrote that and there is no email or text making any such statement, as will
be noted in my exhibits, you are in conflict with your own lawyer=E2=80=99s
warning. She wrote further, and I am in full agreement with her on this,
that =E2=80=9CYou must not use your children as a weapon in negotiations=E2=
=80=A6=E2=80=9D
Documents will show that I never did. I imagine it is an unfortunate
position to be so clearly contradicting your own lawyer=E2=80=99s warning, =
which
when applied to me is false, but which you state without ambiguity.



So, as long as you continue to use our daughters as weapons in negotiations
with me, when they should be no part this, I will agree to your demands
with prejudice and noting that I disagree vehemently, and strongly
encourage you to think about this from their perspective, and hope you
allow them a normal, healthy life, while we as adults address this in an
approximate way.



I really do hope that happens before this goes before the court. However,
at this point you seem committed to your position, and if you are unable to
act in a way that stops hurting them and starts helping them, I am left
with no other choice.



I will call shortly to speak to them, and unless you are refusing to allow
me any access, I will tell them I am disappointed we couldn=E2=80=99t see e=
ach
other today but I am looking forward to seeing them tomorrow and over the
holidays.



And please respond to me about Christmas, understanding I have to make
plans as well. As for insisting on a supervisor, the family has made it
clear that none are welcome here under the conditions you are forcing me to
accept.



Darryl
