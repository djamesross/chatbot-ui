Hi Any,

To keep busy I=E2=80=99m going through the audio recordings that I have =
to try and find clues about why she=E2=80=99s doing this, and examples =
to support my case.There are so many audio clips that support me and my =
description of Cynthia, but I want to mention this one because it gives =
such a clear picture of how things worked in our house. It=E2=80=99s an =
audio clip  from the afternoon of the day she sent Ben and Sam to her =
parents, and two days before she took the girls away. In it, you can =
hear Alice crying loudly. She was sick, with a fever. I=E2=80=99m taking =
care of her, talking to her, and giving her medicine. In the background =
Charlotte is talking to me, telling me things, and asking me to get her =
milk and put on a show. Cynthia comes downstairs to let me know that Sam =
and a friend are upstairs doing homework, and that she=E2=80=99s going =
out to return some stuff at Winners. I tell her that I=E2=80=99ll order =
pizza for our usual dinner time. She doesn=E2=80=99t try to help with =
Alice, or soothe her, or anything. She doesn=E2=80=99t even say goodbye =
to her. She gets Charlotte milk, and then leaves while Alice is still =
crying. I=E2=80=99m left to soothe Alice, and watch Charlotte and Sam =
(and Sam=E2=80=99s friend). (Cynthia returns about an hour later.)

That was two days before she took the kids away from me to =E2=80=98protec=
t them' - not only leaving them in my care, but leaving me to take care =
of Alice who was sick, to watch the other kids, and to take care of =
dinner (it=E2=80=99s surprisingly hard to order pizza with a sick =
toddler crying in your arms!) -  because she needed to return some =
things at Winners.
