Hi Cynthia,

I'm not trying to hide anything from you. You know I struggled with 
alcohol, and can guess I had a relapse. The discharge paper is literally 
one line: admitted for eto alcohol withdrawal. So I was admitted because 
I've been trying to quit, which, as short as it's been, has been 
successful. It's probably hard for you to understand, but no one, 
certainly I don't, want to experience addiction. It's horrible, and 
withdrawal is dangerous enough that the doctors tell you not to stop 
drinking until you are at the hospital. I was committed and thought I 
could do it myself. So the hospital was due to withdrawal, which can be 
quite dangerous, but something I really wanted. I'm using my benefits 
for counseling, as well as getting extra help from my EAP, and exploring 
other options to ensure it doesn't happen again. In speaking to past 
counselors they don't think I need addiction counseling. Alcohol is a 
symptom of grief and loss, and terrible way of coping with everything 
that's wrong in my life right not, most importantly missing the girls.

I miss them terribly, and its often hard to keep the tears in. Can you 
tell me how they're doing, and what you've told them? And for their 
sake, would you be willing to talk about transitioning back into their 
life? I don't think we need lawyers, which cost money and create 
animosity. I believe we can work together for their sake. The issue at 
stake is their well-being. I'm working as hard as I can to be well for 
myself and for them. Can we at least give it a try?

Darryl

        Thank you for your response. Your explanation is not clear to me
        and does not elevate my concerns.  It sounds like you are saying
        you are dealing with depression and anxiety, and if that is the
        case, I am glad you are getting help. However, that does not
        explain why you were brought to ICU on October 15 or your
        collapse on July 8th while the girls were in your care. 
        <div><br>

        <div>Kindly advise immediately the reasons that you were brought

          from Oct.15-19). Additionally, please provide copies of all of
          the hospital admission, medical and discharge reports related
          to your  hospitalization before we discuss access to the
