Yes, but we talked about the main issue already (the girl's new caregiver, w=
ho won't release the girls to me.)

And here's what Cynthia wrote at the time: "I do want the girls to see you a=
nd am confused as  why you didn't show up on your days." Right. I checked wi=
th Dawn, the new caregiver, and confirmed that she was not expecting me eith=
er day, and had been given no permission to release the girls. In fact has b=
een told not too. (But I will try Wednesday!)

But for a moment I thought she'd gone back to the parenting agreement. why e=
lse ask me why i didn't  pick theM up?

But no, according to her: "We are not back to our parenting agreement. Are y=
ou ok? This text sounds crazy." (Crazy?!) I'll paste the 'crazy' message bel=
ow.)

But following that agreement and learning to be civil sounds like the most r=
easonable thing we could do for the kids, and all of us.=20

I tried for supervised access this weekend, but my family was out of town or=
 couldn't make it. Her suggestion: we meet for a picnic in the park. I jumpe=
d at it. But then thought... there's an ulterior motive.  She's always got u=
lterior motives, I didn't have any witnesses, and she could have made any al=
legation she wanted. So I declined. Her supervising me seemed inappropriate a=
nd uncomfortable for all.=20

What do think?

Oh, and here's my 'crazy' email (which I thought hopeful):

"I was confused too, because you were refusing me access, but I=E2=80=99m so=
 happy to hear that=E2=80=99s over, and we=E2=80=99re back to our parenting a=
greement. I=E2=80=99ll be there! It=E2=80=99s so much better for the girls, s=
aves court costs, follows Heather and Sharon=E2=80=99s recommendations, and i=
s just better for all of us. I=E2=80=99m glad you told Dawn that I=E2=80=99l=
l pick the the girls up Wednesday and Thursday [no way that's happened] and I=
 can=E2=80=99t wait to see them tomorrow. I really do think 50-50 is best fo=
r them, and I=E2=80=99m committed to it. Family is all over the place this w=
eekend, but there are two little girls who are looking forward to playing wi=
th Charlotte and Alice tomorrow. I told told them 3:00 pm."
