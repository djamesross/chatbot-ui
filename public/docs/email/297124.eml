Just some more thoughts that have come up after reviewing Cynthia=92s =
claims -
- Either she is making the worst decisions ever (like if any of this was =
true, it would be unbelievable that she=92s waited until now to raise =
concerns) - to the point that I couldn=92t trust her to take care of the =
children with a new partner. What if she ignored all of these signs with =
her next boyfriend or husband?
- Or - and this is the reality - she=92s making it all up as she goes.

Cynthia has claimed, at various points, that:
- she had to lock herself and daughters in a room to protect from Darryl =
(communications with Cindy Mclaughlin; not brought up with dr. or =
affidavit; will check with CAS)
- writes in affidavit that I have bitten both girls, at various times, =
over the previous summer (no dates)
- tells attending dr. at CHEO that I have bitten Charlotte twice, and =
that she believes that i am sexually assaulting her (nothing about =
Alice)
- claims to have found blood stained pjs
- claims that i displayed bizarre behaviour, of which she is the only =
witness
- her mother claims that Charlotte said strange things
- does not take Charlotte to CHEO until 9 days after she leaves, and 3 =
days after she is served=20
- worried that i am sexually assaulting daughter, but begins marriage =
counselling in September, during which no concerns are raised about =
treatment of children by Darryl
- only contacts family therapist, Dr. James, in September because Darryl =
and marriage counsellor urge her to, but does not raise any concerns =
about girls (only about Ben, who has threatened suicide and self-harm)

Any, I just can=92t believe that she can hold onto the children through =
all of this. It=92s just crazy.

Darryl
