Hi Sharon,

That looks like a great solution! I like the routine during the week, and th=
ink it will be good for the girls. As for Friday and Sunday, I think that we=
 can cooperate enough to switch when necessary (family events, etc.). Cynthi=
a has agreed to it, so we=E2=80=99ll probably begin it on the 12th.

Thank-you for letting me know about the report. Do you know when you will be=
 able to complete it?

Finally, I'd like set up an appointment. Do you have availability on the 16t=
h?

Best,

Darryl=
