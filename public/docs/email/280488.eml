Hi Darryl.


As for testing I agree in a local professional but those are separate from
a professional counsellor she can trust. If you can look into testing that
would be helpful and please look for one who is on the less expensive side
as I have a yearly limit for me benefits.


As for general counselling cost and time are and issue.

The price doubles for Ottawa therapists. I do not have the funds to pay the
difference at this time as the testing will take up a large portion of my
benefits.

Parents can meet virtually with therapist to discuss any issues. I
currently meet virtually with my own therapist and now with the girls
teachers.

 As you are aware,  I work two jobs with one them mandated in the office
for three days a week and girls are both in competitive soccer which I am
solely responsible for so our time is incredibly limited.

The Hamilton office has a great reputation and works with kids. How about I
send the info with  the recommendations so you can take a look?
