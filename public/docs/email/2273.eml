Hi,  Darryl,=20

=20

Thanks for having us.. that was delicious!   I agree, we should make a regu=
lar thing - maybe once a month - out of dinner - vary the location.=20

=20

I agree that leasing keeps payments down, as you are only 'buying' part of =
the car's value.  But plan your mileage allowance carefully.   Overages are=
 hideously expensive ($0.45 or more per km) , and so is early lease termina=
tion.   These fees can easily run into 1000s of dollars.  Maintenance, both=
 mechanical and cosmetic, is often a contractual obligation. You may be exp=
ected to 'make good' any damage the car suffers.  This often includes paint=
 scrapes, upholstery tears, and similar small items as well as anything not=
 covered by the warranty. =20

=20

Sooo... some variables to think about.  But if you're like most of us, your=
 car will be reasonably taken care of, these potential issues will not beco=
me real ones, and leasing will work out to be a good deal.=20

=20

As per the car financing: sure, we're on board for that - up to a reasonabl=
e max liability.  Let's find out what the numbers are & go from there.=20

=20

BTW, I know it's tough to ask these things of us. Remember that Cindy, I an=
d all of the rest of us are ready to support you as best we can.=20

=20

Love,=20
Todd.=20
