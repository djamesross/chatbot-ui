Hi Any,

I forgot to ask about the financials. I=E2=80=99m going to bug my =
pension provider again, to find out that amounts, and get those to you =
as soon as I can.

Can you confirm for me about the loss we took on the house - Cynthia put =
it as a disposition, before the valuation date (like her RRSP loss), but =
it=E2=80=99s an actual cost that we paid after the valuation date (and =
she claimed a loan of 12,500 from her mother, which is the same amount). =
We talked about it and agreed it should be claimed after the valuation =
date.

And for child support, there would be a fairly small amount due (around =
$100/month), but my salary dropped a little, and her=E2=80=99s may have =
gone up. Either way, is that an amount that we can actually request? I =
know it=E2=80=99s small, but it would actually help me (pay for swimming =
lessons and gymnastics, for starters).=20
