Hi Heather,

I just left a message for you. Jennifer took over our file, but she=E2=80=99=
s on vacation, and a few things have come up that I am hoping I can get =
some advice on. I need some help on how to talk with Cynthia about some =
issues that are starting to come up, in the most productive way I can. =
If you have time would you mind talking briefly?

I am flexible the next few days, and can be reached at 613-762-2067.

Thanks,
Darryl=
