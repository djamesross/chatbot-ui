Hi Darryl,

Thanks for letting me know about changing today's call. The girls have
plans at 4pm thus cannot speak with you at your suggested time.

Are you able to try later at 6pm or tmrw before noon? They have a PD this
Friday.

As for their schooling, they are both managing virtual school quite well.
Charlotte is understanding the lessons and handing in her assignments on
time. Alice's reading and comprehension in French continues to improve and
she participates fully in all classes. I am hopeful they will be able to
return to school soon but for now they have adjusted well.

They are both still active and get out daily, in some form- sledding,
hiking, playing in the snow and now skating!

As for in-person visits, I will speak to Alison and get back to you. As you
remember, we are still awaiting for a long list of requested documents that
support your health claim.

Cynthia
