I am communicating with your lawyer as you requested, however since you
wrote me about this issue I will respond. The issue of supervision was
settled by CAS almost two years ago, and this has nothing to do with care
for or the safety of the girls. I will be in communication with your lawyer
to formally address this issue.

However, Alice and Charlotte are more important than debating this issue.
So I will accept your condition under duress for the best interests of the
girls. But if you do not accept my mother as a supervisor, who was an RN
and raised two children, there is no one else capable of meeting the
condition of your comfort level, which is a condition that is vague and
subjective. So in order to act responsibly toward the girls, and avoid
cancelling access and Ali's only opportunity to have her birthday
celebrated with her father is to meet at a park on or around her birthday
while you remain close by to ensure your comfort. This will also
demonstrate that your intention has not been to ostracize me or to cause
the girls emotional hardship.

Sincerely,
Darryl
