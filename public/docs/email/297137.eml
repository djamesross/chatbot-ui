I just got the records from CHEO and spoke with the attending nurse who admi=
tted Charlotte. The results are totally clear - there is no evidence of abus=
e or STIs. The doctor referred Cynthia to CAS based solely on her account, a=
nd not based on any medical/physical concerns, i.e., no "red flags."

The nurse remembered them, and said that Cynthia told her that I was trying t=
o prove her an unfit mother, so she was trying to prove me an unfit father (=
that's off the record I'm sure).=20

The nurse, who is on the sexual assault team, also said that they don't do k=
its or any of the more invasive stuff if it's been longer than 72 hours - ju=
st a basic physical. And get this: Cynthia only took her in two days ago, at=
 12:41 pm.

The chart says that Cynthia reported finding "blood on daughter's PJs. Mom d=
id not see blood on child's leg." There were no pjs with blood - I'm positiv=
e. But at this point I wouldn't put it past her to fake it. But going with h=
er story, she found these pjs, picked them up, but waited 9 days to bring Ch=
arlotte to CHEO? I did laundry shortly after she took them, before she came b=
ack to get things, so she can't say she picked them up later.

Cynthia reported to the doctor that I "bit daughter x2 on arm."

And, it says explicitly that Cynthia "more recently concerned about sexual a=
buse bc bizarre behavior."

Again, if she was really concerned about this wouldn't she mention it in her=
 affidavit? I feel like the difference between the two undermines her argume=
nt.=20

Still trying to contact CAS worker.=20
