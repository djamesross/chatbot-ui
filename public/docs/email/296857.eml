Hi Any,

Did you know about the email below?

I=E2=80=99m confused by this message: its from Cynthia to my family. =
Does it mean that she plans on keeping our schedule, where I get the =
girls for two days/nights, as long as someone is here? I assumed I would =
get a couple of hours. If she=E2=80=99s willing to let the girls stay =
here, as long as a family member is present, that would be amazing, but =
we=E2=80=99ll have open the language to find family members that can do =
this on a weekly basis - which I want to do, but not all family members =
can do. (And which would also be good because they could vouch for me =
not drinking)

It sounds like you are working hard to get the best outcome, and it =
sounds like Cynthia is willing to cooperate. If she is, genuinely,I am =
so willing to work with her, and I=E2=80=99m willing to go to any =
lengths to make this work, and work better. It=E2=80=99s just been hard, =
given the past, and her accusations.=20

Before I make too much of this, please let me know what you think.

Darryl
