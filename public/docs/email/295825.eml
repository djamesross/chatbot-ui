I called, emailed & texted Kristian. I'll let you know when I hear from =
him, but go ahead and make plans in the meantime because my impression =
is that it's a grown-up thing.

I'd like to take the boys to see Hugo tomorrow, at Empire 7. It plays at =
3:20 (& 12:30), and is 4.99 a person with free parking.

I emailed Nick to see when they are free today/tomorrow. I suggested an =
early evening with wii. The boys can play for a while with us. Nick is a =
last minute planner, so we'll play it by ear.

My work schedule:
Today-Wednesday: work until 2-3 pm (depending on our plans), but I'm =
flexible during the day and can work more in the afternoon if you need =
me in the morning.
Thursday: work in morning, teaching 11:30 - 2:30
Friday: teach 8:30-11:30

Love you, even when you're a martyr!=
