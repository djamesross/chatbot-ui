After the incident yesterday involving your conversation with my mother
which caused her distress and my discussion with  my lawyer's office, I
want to clarify the supervised visits for going forward:

   - Supervised access will take place at Indigo or a public library unless
   mutually agreed upon ahead of time.
   - The supervisor is to know about your whereabouts at all times, if you
   leave with the children to pick up a snack etc, you must advise the
   supervisor.
   - You are not to engage in unnecessary conversation with the supervisor,
   please keep your focus on spending time with Alice and Charlotte.


Your workplace is no longer a suitable place for visits as it's difficult
for the supervisor to know your  whereabouts with the girls.

As such, today's make up visit can take place at Indigo or the library,
your choice. Additionally, Sunday's visit  will need to take place at
either location stated above.

As discussed with my lawyer, I would like to remind you that a transition
to 50/50 is gradual. Additionally before the children can visit your new
residence, I will require a visit with the family you live with and a tour
of the home.


Cynthia
