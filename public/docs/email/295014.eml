Hi Dr. Cebulski,

I'm writing in regard to an assessment you did for Benjamyn Leclair, =
April 10, 13 & 17. First, a quick question: can you recommend anyone =
that specializes in CBT for childhood ADHD?=20

And second, Ben's dad has taken a sudden interest in the diagnosis, =
prompted by personal fears about medication. We shared the report with =
him, and explained the process and tests used. He believes that Ben is =
just going through 'growing pains,' that he's a normal boy (which of =
course he is), and that discipline will help. He's skeptical of the =
diagnosis and of the procedure.

He's indicated that he'd like to contact you to follow-up, and Cynthia =
and I wanted to let you know that he may call for more information.

Best,
Darryl
