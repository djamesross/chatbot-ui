Darryl,

Unfortunately, no appointments were available Monday as I called the office
and the nurse said I had to call first thing Tuesday to secure an urgent
care appointment as our family doctor was not available. This was the only
option with the clinic, you can call to conform. Unfortunately this was
during your time. Please call the doc office for the notes. Alice
returned home with me because she needed to pass a hard stool. All of this
is in the notes from Dr. Folkerson. UTIs with constipation are common at
this age, Dr. Folkerson explained this as well.

As for missed time due to her being seen by a doctor, I can offer extended
time this Sunday from* noon-7pm*. Let me know if your mom and you are
available.

 If you recall we did agree on extending the time on Thanksgiving Sunday.

To date, if a time is missed, we have managed to make up the time on
alternative dates.

Cynthia
