Hi Cynthia, as you know I said that it was a good idea and agreed that you
should come see the place and meet the family even before I moved in so
that's not a question, the only question is if they're back Saturday night
or Sunday morning and how busy they are getting ready for school and work.
Hopefully you can bring the girls by and meet them on Sunday. But if not
then sometime next week. Now they have made it clear that I'm the tenant
here and they want nothing to do with our past or history or drama. You
showed no interest in meeting Riva or anyone else but you are welcome here
as the girl's mom and they're going to be very nice and hopefully their
kids will be around too. Nev and Quin are very polite and mature kids.

I expect my private life to be kept private because I have a right to move
on and to continue to progress, which I have done for well over a year now
as documented medically, with the support of the children's aid society in
contrast to gossip and rumour.

I'm sorry you're unwilling to compromise about Thursday and have forbid my
mom from supervising which she always did with that with a problem, and
which would take pressure off your parents who you put more emphasis on
then the girls and their need and right to see and spend time with their
dad. On what basis you're going to be able to argue that you've had the
right to do this and it's been justified and in the best interest of the
girls I have no idea because you and your lawyer refuse to talk to me but
you've left it up to a judge to decide because you've refused every other
option so be it

As for Thursday like usual you tell me how long, who's going to be here,
and I do exactly as you say because you're holding my daughter's hostage
and preventing me from parenting them and controlling how close I can be to
them. So it's really not a question, and it may sound nice, but you've got
them hostage and I have to do what you say if I want to see them, and
there's nothing more that I want then to see them.

This has been incredibly hard on me and incredibly hard on the girls, we
couldn't even have Christmas dinner together on boxing day, the day after
you guys celebrated your Christmas, but the girls and I have no say because
you keep strict control of them, and so it goes until the courts reopen and
I submit the motion and we get a final order.

As usual I have to say that I am completely opposed to supervision and I am
only doing it because it's the only way I get to see my daughters.

After taking them away with no justification for months, confusing them,
limiting my time as much as possible, in settings schedule according to
what your current parents can do, pain causing the girls anxiety by telling
them that I'm still sick - its not about baby steps anymore.

Darryl
