Hi Jane, I know it's been awhile since we've spoken but I have been making
progress. Cynthia Has been acting erratically making decisions one way and
then another and in between.  she's put herself in a very bad position. I
have had some very serious confidence issues and out but I've worked
through those and I'm fully focussed on the girls and their rights. I am
ready and confident and prepared to go forward with this, have requested
Alison's availability, however, I would like to ask for your help
completing the motion because I'm not sure exactly what to ask for for,
demand or, however it should be put. What i would like to ask you is if you
could help me draft the motion. I will find a way to pay you for that
upfront, and hopefully we could do it in a single meeting if possible.

Either way I appreciate your consideration and hope to hear back from you.

Darryl
