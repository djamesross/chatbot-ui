Hi Darryl,
I brought Charlotte to CHEO today because her shoulder was still bothering
her from the weekend when she injured it at soccer. The Xray showed no
broken bones, after examination they concluded she has a suspected
supraspinatus injury with decreased mobility and have recommended sports
medicine physio. She will take tonight practice off, and depending on how
she feels on Sunday. Monday afternoon she sees her physiotherapist for his
recommendations.

As for absences I agree they are high, she has had a rough year in terms of
health and has missed days from being sick and injured. She also misses
quite a few days for soccer tournaments etc.. bc  she is in the special
program. Her marks are great and I have received excellent feedback from
her teachers so I am not that concerned.  Cutting out gluten has really
helped her overall health as she was experiencing extreme fatigue,
headaches and stomach aches.

She has a chrome book so does catch up on work.
