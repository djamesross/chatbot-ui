Hi Allison,

I understand how the judge ruled about support payments now, and it is =
incorrect.=20

Let me know when you would like to discuss the decision. I have an =
appointment this afternoon from 2-4 pm but I am going to try to change =
it. It would be helpful for me to schedule a time to talk.

Thanks,

Darryl
