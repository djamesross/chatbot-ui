Hi Babe,

I found your coffee on the table - I hope you can get some there!

This morning went well. All the kids were great. Sam was nervous, but =
playing before getting on the bus relaxed him, and Ben is sitting with =
him and supporting him. Leaving Charlotte was of course very hard, but =
she is in great spirits.

How is it going there? Do you have much to do?

Love you!=
