Without prejudice,

We can meet there and eat but can't spend two hours there. This level of
controlling and interfering with my relationship with my daughters is
unnecessary and unjustified.

I will meet there for a meal but except to be able to do more.

Please keep me up to date on Ali, and when make up time can be arranged.
