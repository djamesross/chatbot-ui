Hi Darryl,

The girls are having a busy first week back. Both are very happy to be back
in school and excited to start a new term with their friends. As you can
see, Charlotte has Mme. Nadia and she is a new brand teacher, so far
Charlotte thinks she is ok. She is most pleased that her two best
friends are in the class with her.

Alice is with Mme. Lisa, who is amazing! You might remember she was
Charlotte's first grade teacher. She is very kind and excellent with her
students. Alice has one bff Clara in her class and is able to play with her
other friends at recess.

Unfortunately, Charlotte re-sprained her left ankle at soccer this week.
Because the sprain keeps returning, I am taking her to physio next week so
she can work on strengthening her ankle to avoid re-injuring it. I also
purchased an air boot and crutches so that she is comfortable at school.
She missed class yesterday because of this.

As for treatment for the girls, as I mentioned to you back in Spring, they
both received individual counselling through Serenity Renewal with Kyla
Groves  as well as, they completed the B.A.B.E.S. program. Attached are
their certificates. The program is explained here
https://www.serenityrenewal.ca/4048-2/

At the beginning of August, I started searching for some individual
counselling for Charlotte. As you can appreciate, wait times and
availability for child therapists have been  much longer due to the mental
health from the pandemic. I am currently meeting with a child therapist to
speak about my concerns with Charlotte and to see if they would be a good
fit. I will keep you posted on the outcome.


As for the gifts and cards, I will make arrangements for porch pick up at
your residence. Please e-mail me a few times that are suitable for you and
I will have someone pick it up on the porch.

Best,

Cynthia
