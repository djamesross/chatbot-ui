Hi Darryl,



This is difficult for me to bring up again but it=E2=80=99s important. My m=
om
suspected you were had been drinking prior to your visit with the girls at
Regatta Park this past Tuesday. You did not engage much with the girls,
instead spent all the time speaking with my mom and were not clear on the
day. We are happy to talk with you but these visits are about bonding with
the girls and you need to be sober when you are with them. She did smell
alcohol on your breath. If you are not up for the visit bc you had some
drinks please just cancel, we understand. We need to start building some
trust in this area.



Going forward we are prepared to do one two-hour visit on the weekend on
Sundays with Dennis supervising. You can arrange it with my mom as she
knows our schedule. If you want more, please discuss with Lynda Reece to
find a solution.



I=E2=80=99m happy you and I are communicating more openly and we are here t=
o
support you through all of this and want to see you getting better.


Take care,


Cynthia
