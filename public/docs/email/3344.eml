Hi Cynthia,

It was a great game tonight, and as always wonderful to see the girls,
until we can put in place a new access schedule.

Had I not biked each night to all the local soccer fields, I would not have
found out that not only are you not allowing me to see my daughter on her
birthday for the second year in a row, but that you are also taking her out
of town to a place you have not informed me of or given me notice of,
particularly during Corvid. I=E2=80=99m concerned how this will make Charlo=
tte
feel, and how you=E2=80=99ve explained to her that her dad is completely ex=
cluded
from her birthday, and soccer, school, and the other events in her life. I
asked her if I could and she decided on a cake, which she was expecting and
excited for (a soccer ball), so we will need to arrange a time to do that.

As for the phone, now that you=E2=80=99ve told me it is hers, I will make s=
ure I
send no adult conversation through it, and thank you for informing me that
this is the case. Neither of us wants the girls to feel or experience any
disagreement between us. I have been sending messages to them since they
are not receiving, so I assumed you were still the primary user. They=E2=80=
=99ve
told me they are not receiving many of the calls and messages I=E2=80=99m l=
eaving
for them. Perhaps you could check it works properly?

I would prefer that we could talk about all the decisions that fall under
co-parenting, or discuss an alternative arrangement, engaging a parent
coach, mediation, etc. Or do you have a proposal? If not,  it will have to
be left to a judge to decide.

Best,

Darryl
