Hi Any,

Cynthia finally acknowledged the custody and access assessment, and refused t=
o agree to it.=20

Here is her statement to me:

"I'm not interested in a third party assessment; it's costly, stressful and w=
ill get us nowhere. The 2-2-3 schedule has worked fine for the girls. We jus=
t need to figure out summers. =20
Also CAS has closed the case for Charlotte, I spoke to Heather at length and=
 they are the experts. I told our family therapist I no longer feel Charlott=
e was/is being sexually abused as she hasn't disclosed anything to me and th=
ere are presently no signs (as I do watch for them). I suspected it and took=
 the proper steps to make sure my daughter was safe.=20

Darryl, if presently suspected you were sexually abusing Charlotte, I would b=
e in a court room battling this out. I=E2=80=99ve educated myself on the sig=
ns, connect with the sexual abuse centre, educated the girls on their body a=
nd I know what to watch for."

Sharon is back from vacation, and I will get in touch with her today.=20

Darryl=
