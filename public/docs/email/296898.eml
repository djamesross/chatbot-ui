Hi Any,

Here is Cynthia's response, which makes clear her position: she states clear=
ly that I need her permission.

She's taken sole custody, whether I agree or not. However, she mentions lega=
l mediation. Did you talk to Alison? I wonder if that's why she's suggesting=
 it.

Darryl

 I did not lay out that condition as you gave me the impression you would be=
 at Cindy's party the whole time. I was under the impression that once you c=
onfirmed Todd was driving, and picking them up at 130 pm, you would be at th=
e party the whole time and that he would drop them off.me.
