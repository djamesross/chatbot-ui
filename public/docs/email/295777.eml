Without prejudice,

Yes, I asked the girls for ideas. Hopefully the weather will be nice.

As always, I oppose these supervised visits because they interfere with and
control my relationship with the girls, restrict the girls rights to be
with me as their parent, and because they're not in the girl's best
interests.
