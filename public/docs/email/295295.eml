Ms. Boyce,

I assumed Ms. Holmes and I were working in good faith, and despite advice
to the contrary did not recognize that was not the case. I have made these
points ad nausea, trying to avoid conflict, but it=E2=80=99s clear court is=
 the
only option left available.

Primarily, I have been asking two broad questions, to no avail:
- Why has your client continually ignored joint custody?
- Why has your client taken every effort to reduce my access to the girls
after overcoming my own addiction, which I was open and honest about?

Furthermore, I have asked and kindly request a response to the following:
- Why has your client ignored my requests to all forms of avoiding court
and conflict? (The dates, I understand, will become important on this point
in particular.)
Further:
- Why has your client continued to cross boundaries clearly set, such as
entering my living space after being asked not to, and after CAS made clear
there are no restrictions justified any longer?
- I have asked why Ms. Holmes continually changes her position,
accusations, and set rules she has no right to set.
- Your have written multiple times you would respond, as has your client,
and yet never have. Why?

I have read the research and understand why most parents in my position
simply capitulate. I will not. The girls benefit immensely from their time
with me, I provide more stability, and I show concern for their emotions
and needs.

After arbitrary and unjustified action, Ms. Holmes has finally taken the
correct step to justify her action, acting as if there was genuine concern
for the girls and notified CAS. Why has it taken this so long, and come
only after my last letter, and only after withdrawing her claim supervision
is necessary and communicating directly with my mother, asking that we take
further responsibility?

- Why after being told has she once again arbitrarily taken the position
she has reason and right to remove all access to my daughters?
- Why have I received no response after providing medical documentation?

I contacted CAS immediately upon receiving your client=E2=80=99s email and =
the the
following day found out Heather Clarke is our case worker. I have left a
message for he as their office is closed to to the virus outbreak, and will
follow up today.

I naively thought this was something she had to work through and would
change, and time would resolve the situation. Clearly that is not the case.
I believe I have found enough case law to justify that status quo does not
apply, I have documented the many inconsistency in your client=E2=80=99s ac=
tions,
and will show your client actively limits my contact with my daughters, and
has tried to prevent me from parenting, trying to maintain control over
their relationship with me.

This is a pattern for which I have ample documentation shared with me when
by your client doing the same with Ben and Sam and their father. I have
overcome my personal problem, which emerged after truly horrible
accusations were made and then maintained after agreeing to shared custody,
that put me in financial hardship. I was open and honest about it, and even
sacrificed my own feelings to do so. At no point have safety or other
concerns been raised since until now, other than through accusation. Why
did you client not immediately contact authorities after refusing access to
my daughters in August?

I made clear boundaries which have repeatedly been crossed. Avoiding and
shying from conflict is not, in this case, the answer any longer. I am
writing to put her on notice that I will be filing a court case on the only
grounds that matter: the best interests of our daughters. I have and will
take no other actions, despite accusations to the contrary.

Furthermore, you client has made my current living arrangements extremely
difficult without right or cause, and based only on accusation. Ms. Holmes
does not have the right to do so. The onus is on your to prove these
allegations. Instead, what will become clear, is that she has taken every
effort to limit contact, unless watched over by an agency like CAS or
during a period she required childcare. (The summer, for which there is
ample evidence).

What I am considering now is the whether her continued attempts to limit my
access and now completely remove access to my daughters and ability to
parent without cause is better dealt with before or after the new laws take
effect in 2020. And again the deciding factor is what is the best interests
of the girls, not how I feel or how aggressive Ms. Holmes is toward me. I
will decide based on legal advice and in consultation with a child
psychologist.

Again to you I apologize for not being clearer and firmer on dates and
understanding how the family law rules work. I will be sure to research
them more thoroughly, and retain legal advice when possible.

I fully expect and welcome their visit tomorrow, which I have for the
reasons above. However, I will be pursuing this because our daughters lives
cannot change on your client=E2=80=99s whims. Your client=E2=80=99s actions=
 clearly show
that this is not about concern for the girls. The claims that precipitated
this latest action are false. They claim that I was unreachable Sunday. Yet
a text at 12:20 did not need to be answered again. It was answered, and
re-sending it was unnecessary. A text at 1:36 was responded to within 3
minutes. I had already set a clear boundary and asked your client to
respect them, months after CAS closed the case: she is not welcome to walk
uninvited into my living space. Yet did so aggressively, knowing full well
I was trying to finish a promise to my daughter, and that being tired or
just waking up is not grounds for refusing access to children, Just like
the accusation of molestation, she has ignored the fact that I have a sleep
disorder.

I will no longer accept the position of being a father ignored in hopes she
changes her mind, and be prevented from parenting my daughters so that they
only thing left is to make toys for my daughters.
I will be proceeding regardless of a response.
