Thank-y0u!

As I was going through boxes I came across some legal documents. They =
are things that she left behind and  never asked for, but there are =
letters from the executor of the estate from her (sort-of) grandmother, =
who left her $48,500. She told me, and told me again when her sister got =
it, that it was 25k - so already that=E2=80=99s a red flag! (There are =
so many, I know=E2=80=A6)=20

Question: she told me that she received the inheritance when she was =
with Scott (the boy=E2=80=99s dad), but hid it from him because he =
was,.. (everything I am supposed to be!). I feel really uncomfortable =
about this, but does Scott have any right to that, after this time? =
(It=E2=80=99s been 9 years)

Honestly Any, it=E2=80=99s been so hard to bring this up=E2=80=A6 And I =
hate myself for it=E2=80=A6 But if I can get some leverage to help my =
girls, I have to take it...

(Ugh.)

Darryl
