Alison, please send your availability before you leave or I will really
have to book it at my convince. It's unfair to the girls to wait any
longer.

Cynthia, that was a valiant effort at negotiation for part of one day, but
negotiation is not a directive telling me what I have to do while refusing
input.

The temporary order has to be changed and I will be starting the motion
next week. If we can cooperate, all the better. If not, the motion I submit
will be expanded and I will be seeking costs.

Darryl
