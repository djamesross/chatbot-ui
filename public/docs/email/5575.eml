Hi Cynthia,

The girls can certainly be ready to be picked up at 6 pm, but I will =
have to check with my mom to see if our visit can be moved to Saturday =
or earlier Sunday. George plays with a band at a local restaurant =
Saturday and Sunday afternoons, but I think we can arrange something for =
Saturday,

Given that it is a long weekend and holiday I wanted to discuss =
arranging a longer visit with the girls or an additional visit for that =
weekend. Visits have been going very well, the girls are very =
comfortable, and they have been asking for longer visits. If me mom is =
available I=E2=80=99m proposing Saturday 12:30 pm - 7:30 pm.

Darryl
