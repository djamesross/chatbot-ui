Hi Allison,

I agree the timing on her part was not ideal. But to me the more serious =
issue is that the email was written and delivered as a fait accompli. =
Had you opened the email  right at 2:18 pm Friday afternoon and sent it =
to me immediately, and I responded to it right away with clear =
directions, and Ms. Boyce got your reply shortly after, it wouldn=E2=80=99=
t have made a difference. Cynthia doesn=E2=80=99t feel like she has =
discuss any matters with me, or explain her decision to me or for anyone =
who may later read the correspondence. And worse, Ms. Boyce isn=E2=80=99t =
communicating with you any differently than Cynthia communicated with =
me, so it=E2=80=99s a waste of time and money. Cynthia=E2=80=99s =
following her own order, and Alison is just saying what she was saying, =
two steps removed.=20

I thought that this motion would bring some stability to the basic =
issues it address, and that we would both have to follow the judge=E2=80=99=
s decision. Seems naive now. If I=E2=80=99m being realistic, if she =
didn=E2=80=99t have to follow the previous order, and without any =
significant consequence financially or otherwise, I don=E2=80=99t see =
any reason why she will follow this one.

Just on the issue of Alice suddenly having plans to be away for =
scheduled parenting time, if Cynthia or Ms. Boyce told me that Alice =
would like to spend a few days at her cousins in Hamilton, and would I =
agree to a visit with Charlotte Sunday and a make-up visit with just =
Alice, I would have said sure. Alice is good at making decisions for =
herself, I=E2=80=99d get one on one time with Charlotte, and then =
one-on-one time with Alice. It would actually be great. But when Cynthia =
dictates one thing, she knows she can dictate anything.=20

There are a lot of issues I want to discuss but it feels pointless, like =
a rigged game of whack-a-mole. Constantly reacting but getting nowhere: =
address one issue, another one pops up. Cynthia owns the game, and I=E2=80=
=99m just a player running out of quarters.

What I=E2=80=99d really like to know is how to establish and maintain =
some basic parameters so there is at least some stability and relative =
certainty for me, and more importantly for our children, to count on, =
and to build on.

Given all the issues and who Cynthia is, what would you suggest?

Thank you,

Darryl
