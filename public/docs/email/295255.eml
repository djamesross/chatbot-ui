Today was another example of interference and obstruction of my =
parenting time. I was not informed that Alice had UTI symptoms, again. =
Or that she=E2=80=99d had symptoms for at least several days.  I was not =
informed of it or that she may need a doctors appointment. You booked an =
appointment during the 3 hours of court order parenting time before =
communicating with me, and then made the decision not to return her.

Going forward I will take them to any appointments that are necessary if =
they are scheduled during my parenting time, and appointments will only =
be made during my parenting time in discussion with me.

With regard to the issue of wrongly withholding Alice, it is important =
to note that Alice did not miss Kenzie=E2=80=99s birthday party Sunday =
despite having symptoms, or miss school Monday, Tuesday, or last, =
despite having symptoms of something that you know is a recurring and =
ongoing issue. This is at least her third time going to the doctors for =
a UTI. Yet somehow a doctor=E2=80=99s appointment had to be made during =
the 3 hours of court ordered parenting time with me for the week, and =
then you texted me that you were not returning her to me because she had =
to poop. Then you texted me at 7:34 pm, 4 minutes after my parenting =
time, that she is feeling much better and doing much better. As soon as =
Charlotte left I texted you and asked you to let Alice FaceTime me. That =
was at 7:54 pm. For future reference it is now 9:27 pm and you have =
ignored a reasonable and right request. I just wanted to talk to Alice =
after her doctors appointment, to see how she=E2=80=99s doing, and to =
say goodnight to her. You denied me that opportunity today. That is one =
level of wrong. The higher level of wrong, the one that everyone cares =
about, the only one the court will care about, is that you denied Alice =
that opportunity.=20

The judge found that you you interfered with and harmed my relationship =
with our daughters. This is direct harm done to them. And despite =
another court order it is openly continuing, and happened today. The =
judge left me the option make an application to the Office of The =
Children=E2=80=99s Lawyer and I will make that application on their =
behalf if this continues.

In terms of today and unlawfully withholding Alice during my parenting =
time despite a court order, make up time is the reasonable and the only =
way to address today and move forward in a positive way that takes =
Alice=E2=80=99s needs and rights into account. Kindly let me know a time =
that will work this weekend in addition to extra time Sunday with both =
of them for Thanksgiving and the long weekend.
