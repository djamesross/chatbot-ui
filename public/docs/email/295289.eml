While contact with family is important, the situation with my sister is
very toxic. My daughters do not need to and will not benefit from two
people who are making false accusations against me to purse their own
interests. They have made public statements that may constitute libel
because they have been shared and documented. I strongly oppose your
interference with my family matters.

Children are adept at picking up on subtle signals and signs, and this
will further confuse them. This is not healthy for my daughters and
further confuses them, and you should be aware of this and protect our
children.

As documented, when I tried to inform you simply that my sister may start
to make false accusations and that they was a toxic situation brewing with
my family you told me you wanted nothing more to do with it, and only
wanted to stay out of it. This leaves me confused as to why you are
increasing contact with them at this point.

Finally, this is time that I could be spending with my daughters, in
healthy way, which the courts repeatedly state is preferential.

Furthermore, I'm glad you able to travel frequently, but there are two
nights coming up that the girls would prefer to with me would and benefit
from from the contact. It wold also help to show you are not actively
trying to restrict their time with me and are sincere in your claims to
rebuild trust. Until my motion is submitted less adversarial options
remain, and I hope you consider them.

Darryl
