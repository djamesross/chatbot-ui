Hi Darryl.

I spoke with the girls on this one as well.

I am agreeable to unsupervised for the week night and have your mother
there for Sunday for the time being.

However, because you don=E2=80=99t have a license or access to a vehicle th=
is puts
the responsibility on me which is more money, time and wear and tear on my
 vehicle. Before I agree to this I want to look into solutions for driving.

For this week I would ask that your mom be there until we can find a
solution.

Cynthia

<br>
The forecast is calling for as much as 100 cm of snow between about 3 pm an=
d 8 pm which is too much for my mom to drive tonight on highways and countr=
y roads. The local roads will likely be bad too. She is available Wednesday=
 or Thursday.<br>
<br>
If the local roads are drivable I propose they be dropped off and picked up=
 this evening as usual. Visits have been supervised for 1.5 years now and I=
 think it=E2=80=99s time to move to unsupervised visits based on the record=
 of the last 18 months of perfect visits. (For comparison, in 2018 followin=
g the direction of CAS they started after one month, so it=E2=80=99s been 1=
8x longer). If they are bad, I propose starting unsupervised visits Wednesd=
ay or Thursday as alternatives.<br>
<br>
Please let me know:<br>
- if you are agreeable to moving to unsupervised visits at this time (or by=
 the end of this month, January, 2024)<br>
- which evening works best: Wednesday or Thursday<br>
