Hi Any,

A few things have come to mind already. Given her track record of lies, =
and bad faith bargaining, I=E2=80=99d like to make it a condition that =
she sign the interim parenting schedule before we meet. I want to know =
that I will be picking the girls up at the agreed upon time, before I =
sit down with her. I think it will make her feel less confident as well. =
I also want to take the house and van out of it. We don=E2=80=99t have =
any payments for the van, so giving it to her means she makes no =
payments, and I have to buy something. I want to go into the meeting =
with the strongest possible position.

What do you think?

Darryl
