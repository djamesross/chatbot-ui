Hi,

We met with Dr. Fraser today for a physical (prep for dental surgery) and
discussed the changes in her diet. We talked about going gluten-free with
Charlotte and her previous symptoms after she ate gluten. She recommended
that if we were concerned if this was a Crones disease that she can take
the blood test after 6 weeks of eating 3 gms of gluten a day. I have the
requisition form for it. It's not covered by OHIP and would cost $90.

In my opinion, I don't think it's necessary, I don't think she has crones
disease and I believe her sensitivity to gluten isn't serious. She is doing
well on her new diet and it's been an easy transition.

I've talked to Charlotte about it and she isn't keen on going through with
the test either.

What are your thoughts?
