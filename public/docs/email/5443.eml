As you know I am in financial hardship. The payments would also be less if
you were not withholding the girls from me. I should be able to pay it
today.

Can you please respond to me about Christmas and the holidays? I will be
sending your lawyer a letter and further information, and kindly ask you to
consider it in terms of the girls' interests.
