Hi Cynthia,

You=E2=80=99re right. And there=E2=80=99s no excuse. Both you and the =
girls deserve consistency. I should have told you immediately when I =
couldn=E2=80=99t make it, and kept you up to date. I know it=E2=80=99s =
all on you and I=E2=80=99m sorry for that. I haven=E2=80=99t said it =
before, but I=E2=80=99m thankful.

Darryl=20
