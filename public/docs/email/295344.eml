Without Prejudice,

Cynthia,

While that is a concession, I cannot countenance the ease with which you =
are willing to use your control of my daughters to further restrict and =
make difficult access. It is clear that I have no intention to take the =
girls during a visit, which is precisely what I explained to my aunt. It =
is also clear that the supervisors you chose demonstrated no effort to =
watch where I am and what I am doing when I am out of sight and with the =
girls. And during those times I have not even considered taking the =
girls and refusing to return them to you.

I understand you are experiencing nonspecific feelings of discomfort, =
and hope that you can find someone to help you recognize that your =
feelings are real, but are not accurate or based on my statements or =
actions. I have long said and continue to believe that the girls need =
both of us, and indeed children do better with two parents. You have =
said similar thins in the past, but your behaviour reveals a very =
different pattern. The girls are fully aware that I am healthy and =
taking care of myself, yet they do not know why you refuse to let them =
see me. And that is an unfortunate position to be in, I understand. You =
would have to say that you have not seen me and do not know my mental or =
physical health, have made no attempt to ask me, have ignored the =
Children=E2=80=99s Aid Society=E2=80=99s concldusions, which I fear will =
confuse the girls who became happier and more confident after my health =
improved and they spent more time with me. Indeed, we worked =
cooperatively toward that goal with Krystle.

Unfortunately you provided only vague, nonspecific allegations, =
primarily in the form of hearsay from people who have not seen me in =
person in over 10 months. Nor have you demonstrated that you have =
reasonable grounds to claim that the girls are not safe while in my =
care. When you necessarily called the police I August the spoke to me, =
agreed with me, and said they saw no evidence to enter the house and =
wake the girls.=20

My behaviour is consistent and has never wavered. I will exercise my =
rights to parent my daughters according to a parenting schedule ordered =
by the court or agreed upon together. It is inappropriate to use my =
daughters to force me to agree to your terms. Furthermore, you are in =
breach of a court order: I am told who will be supervising, where, and =
when, with complete disregard for my rights and the interests of the =
girls, or agreeableness.=20

You offer for visitation at your parents house is inappropriate and =
unacceptable. I can=E2=80=99t comfortably parent my children in the =
house that you first removed them to, I am not comfortable in a home =
that I am not welcome in, and it is not fair to force me to visit with =
my daughters surrounded by  people who are participating in preventing =
me from access to my daughters, and support your unfounded allegations =
Your power to dictate the terms and condition of negligible access is =
the exercise o control without regard for the emotions of my chidren.

Despite my disagreement I have cooperated because it is the only way =
that I can see my daughters right now and I will continue to cooperate =
until a reasonable schedule is established. I will not subject my =
daughters to conflict, I believe that we actually have the ability to =
come to a mutually agreeable schedule, and strongly encourage you to do =
so, which would be a positive example for the girls. However, I have =
been advised not to accept visits in your home or the home of one of =
your family members.=20

If you find it difficult to understand why this is inappropriate, is an =
exercise in control, and why it is contrary to the girls best interests, =
I would encourage you to see Dr. Sharon Francis Harrison, who we began =
to see, and who is highly qualified to help you manage your  emotions.=20=


Nevertheless I desperately want to see my daughters and will accept =
supervisions because you are controlling the girls and refusing =
reasonable access, giving me no other choice. I will agree to supervised =
visitation at Centrepointe Park and will not resist when you have told =
your supervisor they have to be taken away from me.=20

I hope that you consider this from the girls perspective, and set aside =
the confrontational approach that you have chosen.
