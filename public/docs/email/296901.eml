Hi Any,

It went well. She wants to talk to my therapist, and make some recommendatio=
ns, but said she thinks it'll be closed after she's done that.=20

I see my therapist Friday and will talk to her and get the form signed.=20

She's not going to make a change to her recommendation about custody though.=
=20
