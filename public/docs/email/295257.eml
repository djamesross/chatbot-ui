Hi Cynthia,

I=E2=80=99m following up your email sent Dec. 26, below, and my emails =
sent Dec. 25, 26, 28, and the text I sent Dec. 29 (copied below).

Dr. Bowling is on holiday this week but I did attend the clinic most =
recently yesterday, Dec. 29, 2021, to provide a sample that was screened =

that I shared with you dated Dec. 1, 2021.=20

I am out of town from tomorrow morning until Jan. 2. I would like to =
arrange a visit with Charlotte and Alice the afternoon of Jan. 2 or Jan. =
3. Kindly let me know a time that works.

In the event that you are not agreeable to coordinating a visit please =
respond to me so that we can arrange a visit via FaceTime anytime =

holidays.

Best Regards,

Darryl
