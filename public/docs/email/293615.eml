Ms. Boyce,

I understand you have to act in the best in interests of your client, but
there are exceptions. I, on the other hand, am in the sole position of
acting in the best interests of our daughters. The laws taking affect June
1 will, it appears, make this easier.

Your client continues to create evidence against fairly rapid rate
indicating her intent to limit to the extreme and control my daughters
relationship with me, preventing them a meaningful relationship with their
father. Your client contniues to actively work against the following:

   - needs, given their age and stage of development, such as the need for
   stability
   - relationship with each parent
   - relationships with siblings, grandparents and other important people
   in their lives
   - care arrangements before the separation and future plans for care of
   the child
   - views and preferences

It will be far more difficult for your client to continue to justify
ignoring my requests for non-conflictual approaches, refusing to
communicate about a parenting plan, along with other implications as yet to
be put into practice.

Why does she make accusations yet refuse to spend time around me, or accept
medical documentation?
Why does she refuse any for of mediation or parenting coordnation?

I ask you do respond to my questions, and there be a full reversal of her
current actions, which have found no support with the authorities.

But as said, if she is adament and confident in her medical expertise, she
leaves no other options. I this would be a long and difficult process, but
the evidence is overwhelming.

As it stands I expect to see the girls tomorrow and then move as agreed to
shared custody. Given her history I do not expect the girls will taken I to
account and she will not comply. If on the chance she does shift her focus
to the girls, then make up time and ample notice is the only reasonable
response.

Darryl
