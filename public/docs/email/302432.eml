Cynthia,

Today after my mom saw that the girls had arrived I looked out the =
window to see Alice=E2=80=99s cheek and hands pressed against the window =
waiting to be let out of your mom=E2=80=99s car. I raised the issue of =
refusing to let the girls leave the car until my mom comes out and is =
fully visible. Bringing them to my house and making them wait in the car =
until my mom is visible is an extraordinary and a great way to create a =
sense of fear and danger and is not appropriate. The girls have been =
happy, comfortable, and have shown no signs of being uncomfortable or =
any of the anxiety and worry that you describe them experiencing with =
you. Let=E2=80=99s all try not to install feelings like that in them by =
being reasonable. Upon arrival the girls should be free to get out of =
the car and come right in. My mom will always come out to wave whether =
she meets them as they pull up or after they've come in.=20

Darryl
