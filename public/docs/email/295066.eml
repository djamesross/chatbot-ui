Hi,

So here are the details:

In terms of what caused my illness and hospitalization, it was, =
according to the doctors, at least three things in combination. First, =
it was not alcohol poising, and the doctor was very clear that I was not =
experiencing withdrawal.  That said, alcohol was a significant factor. =
However, it didn=E2=80=99t explain the massive electrolyte imbalance, so =
the doctor in ICU told me that there was something wrong with my ability =
to digest and absorb food, which was separate from alcohol. It was a =
malabsorption problem. The third factor they highlighted was sleep, =
which was a major problem for me for about 3 weeks before going to the =
hospital.=20

Treatment: In hospital I was given regular IV doses of electrolytes, in =
fairly massive quantities. When discharged, the doctor at the hospital =
prescribed a maintenance dose of vitamins & minerals.=20

Outcomes and future: all of the symptoms I was experiencing reversed =
while in hospital. I have no symptoms, and I am healthier than I have =
been in years. This was an acute and extraordinary illness. It is not =
chronic and will not return.

On a personal level, and separate from our conversation from the girls, =
I did have a life changing experience, and will not be =E2=80=99sick=E2=80=
=99 and unable to care for the girls ever again (unless, of course, I =
really am sick!). As I said, the doctor made it clear this was not life =
or death, but it was extremely serious, and while I would rather not =
have gone through it, it fundamentally changed me. I finally got the =
full and complete medical attention I needed for a combination of =
physical diseases.

Talking to the girls. I asked Krystle how to talk to them in an age =
appropriate way. Here=E2=80=99s how she worded it (paraphrasing): =
=E2=80=98Daddy was sick because he had an adult drink, something that if =
you have too much or too often can make you sick. It can stop things =
called vitamins and minerals from working in your body, which you need =
to be healthy. Because he had too much, the doctor had to take care of =
him for a while to make him better by replacing all of those vitamins =
and minerals.

But in full honesty and truthfulness, we have to add: daddy had too much =
of that adult drink, which is why he couldn=E2=80=99t see you sometimes. =
But this time was a lot longer because, as you know, he has sleep =
problems, which made it worse and he also needed help with (and they =
know my sleep machine and I=E2=80=99ve talked about my sleep disorder). =
And finally, there was also something wrong with his stomach. When he =
did eat his stomach wasn=E2=80=99t working right. It wasn=E2=80=99t =
sending those vitamins and minerals where they needed to go.

They might ask if it will happen again, so I=E2=80=99m going to tell =
them that it won=E2=80=99t, and that while I might get a cold or the flu =
or something, that illness won=E2=80=99t come back because I=E2=80=99m =
taking vitamins & minerals, eating healthy, sleeping well, and my =
stomach is better now because of the doctors treatment.=20

And I talked to Krystle about how too reframe any worry or anxiety they =
might feel, and she agreed that it's important to say something like: =
sometimes parents might be sick, or need the doctors help getting =
better. You might feel worries and miss us if that happens, but the =
doctor will help us get better and we=E2=80=99ll always come back and =
care for you and love you.

Darryl
