Regarding a caretaker of Charlotte, Margie, who we stopped taking =
Charlotte to. I have the following emails, sent March 28, 2013:
Cynthia: Hi hun, Everything is fine, I had a run in with Margie and we =
should talk. I=E2=80=99m going for a coffee with Fiona at 925 and will =
have my cell.
[Later:]
Me: I have a feeling Margi doesn=E2=80=99t expect us to bring her back =
next week
Cyn: It would be pretty awkward. She was really inappropriate this =
morning
