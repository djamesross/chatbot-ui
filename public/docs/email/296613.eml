sorry to hear that the situation is deteriorating and you are so worried ab=
out your daughters. &nbsp;Do you still have access to their school reports =
and can you talk directly with their teachers? If possible, I would suggest=
 that without implying anything negative, you approach their teachers to as=
k about their observations of the girls. Do they seem happy? &nbsp;Do they =
have friends? Are they progressing as expected? You can ask these questions=
 as an interested parent (not based on any concerns). &nbsp;If the teachers=
 have concerns, the next step may involve speaking with the principal and t=
rying to arrange for a joint parent conference. &nbsp;The whole point is to=
 have object third parties who have direct observations of your children an=

rest. &nbsp;Having third party involvement should help Cynthia to be focuse=

 likely be best that Cynthia not know that you prompted this. &nbsp;I think=
 if you ask the school to do this without indicating that the initial conta=
