Subject: Boo!

Wooooo-hooooo=E2=80=A6.. Booooo!

Ok, so the good news is that my girls are sound asleep in their room. =
They are sleeping like babies. And I=E2=80=99m sitting in a rocking =
chair in the room with them as I type this. (Well, to be honest, Alice =
is tossing and turning, but that would only ruin the image that I hope =
to present. And Charlotte is snoring. And she just farted.)

The bad news is that I had to go to school early, face a hostile =
principal, and watch Cynthia storm into the school before Charlotte even =
got out of her class. It=E2=80=99s a long story, but the =
=E2=80=98deal=E2=80=99 that we agreed to yesterday was a ploy. A =
strategy. They strung me along, told me that it was what they wanted, =
and then at 9 pm last night faxed my lawyer a note saying that Cynthia =
is not comfortable letting the girls stay overnight with me. But by that =
time we had upheld our end of the bargain, and dropped the urgent motion =
we had before the court.

Just to recap, I=E2=80=99ve been accused of truly horrendous crimes. =
Those claims were examined by the police, by the Children=E2=80=99s aid =
society, and by CHEO. Those claims were found to be baseless. I met with =
the CAS case worker and she told me that she sees no reason to withhold =
or restrict my access to the girls. Cynthia's lawyer assured us that as =
soon as the Children=E2=80=99s Aid Society said that there are no =
concerns, we could move to a shared parenting plan.=20

Well, lo and behold, when all the shit was shovelled out of the way, =
there was=E2=80=A6 you guessed it=E2=80=A6 more shit. (That metaphor is =
not as effective for those of you who are currently changing diapers, =
and so literally wiping shit. But still, I think it=E2=80=99s an =
effective literary device.)

Luckily by then, on the advice of my lawyer, we were safely ensconced in =
our home with chains on the door and a new code programmed into the =
garage door opener. So we=E2=80=99re safe, but also in a kind of =
safe-house. (And we just built a ginger bread house!)  It=E2=80=99s not =
the relaxing and carefree weekend with the girls that I had hoped for, =
but with the girls I am. And that, for now, is enough.

I will return them to school Monday morning, and Cynthia will pick them =
up Monday afternoon. After that, I cannot say. I will be there to pick =
them up Wednesday afternoon, as per the spirit of our agreement. But =
regardless of whether or not they are there, it seems very likely that I =
will have my day in court. And if the gods are truly just, to smite will =
renter our modern english lexicon.
