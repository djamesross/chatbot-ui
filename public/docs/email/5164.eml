I=E2=80=99m sorry I missed yesterday - I feel terrible. The place I was goi=
ng to
rent fell through, and I have to be out soon, and last night was the only
night I could look at places. I should have let you know before hand.

With the strike ending it=E2=80=99s chaos here, I=E2=80=99m working part-ti=
me at PetSmart
now, and trying to figure housing out.

I work this weekend, so I=E2=80=99ll check with Todd and find out what work=
s.
Although it looks like the only time I=E2=80=99m available is Saturday afte=
rnoon.
I=E2=80=99ll call him and get back to you.

Also, I want to make sure I FaceTime the girls today. Can we try for 6-6:30=
?

Darryl
