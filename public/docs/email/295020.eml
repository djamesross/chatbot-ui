I got my teaching schedule, and I have an evening class this semester. =
Following Sharon=E2=80=99s suggestions, I=E2=80=99d like to find a way =
for the girls to be with us as much as possible, so I asked her for a =
schedule that would be like our current schedule, but have a few fixed =
nights. Her response is below, and includes the pros and cons.=20

=46rom Sharon:=20

If you want a schedule where the days of the week stay the same but you =
don=E2=80=99t want any period of time away from either parent to be too =
long, then you need to play with the weekends. =20

I can suggest:

Monday and Tuesdays always with Mother
Wednesdays and Thursdays always with Father
Friday always with mother; combined with Saturday on alternate weeks to =
make two days that the children are with her;=20
Sunday nights always with father; combined with Saturday on alternate =
weeks to make two days that the children are with him.=20

Underlined days with Mother. Bold days with Father.
2 week cycle

Monday		Tuesday	 	Wednesday	 	Thursday	 =
	Friday		Saturday		Sunday=20
Monday	 	Tuesday	 	Wednesday	 	Thursday 		=
Friday	 	Saturday	 	Sunday

This schedule gets away from the need to have a mid weekend visit with =
the other parent.
This schedule also brings you close to a 2-2-5-5 schedule that you would =
do with older children. The benefit of this schedule is that each parent =
has consistent days that they have the children during the week, which =
allows each parent to sigh the children up for activities that they =
would like to take the children to.  It also allows the parent to have =
consistent week days that they could sign themselves up for an activity. =
 The down side is that the children never have a Friday night with Dad =
or a Sunday night with Mom.  However, if it is for a short period of =
time, I think this is something everyone could adapt to. =20

~~~~

I think it would be good for  the girls to know which days they=E2=80=99ll=
 be with us during the school week, and think the consistency would be =
good for them. As for Friday and Sunday, I think we can make switches if =
there are special events, like we=E2=80=99ve done so far. Also, we =
wouldn=E2=80=99t need to do the Sunday switch (we=E2=80=99d only have =
one switch per weekend, instead of back and forth).

Let me know if you=E2=80=99re interested in trying it.=
