Yes, that works, and will work well. I would like some ualiry time them,
but please be there, close, for part of the time. I came up with the
initial safety plan and wanted you to see me, offered unexpected drop-ins
you never did: you avoided me, had your parents do it, and then stopped
communication almost completely the better I got. So yes, please come.

In fact let's have some park dates, so you can see me, because this is
about the girls. They know I'm healthy because they spent time with me. You
and I might not enjoy it, but they are the priority, and they should be put
first.
