Subject: re:

So, a detailed parenting plan, a financial settlement, and a divorce.=20

After talking to to Sharon today, I can see no reasonable objections to mov=
ing forward with any of these issues.

Will you agree to move forward on these issues?

If not, do you have reason to delay? If so, why oppose an assessment, paren=
ting coach, or some binding resolution agreement?

Darryl
