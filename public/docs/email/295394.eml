Hopefully this is formatted clearly.

 So it=E2=80=99s true: you expect to say jump, and you assume I will jump, =
on
command. Unfrotunatley for our daughter, who you put well ack in terms of
who is important, I can make neither time nor place, and I truly cannot
believe that you were doing this again. God if I could I just so that our
daughters would not have to experience what they experience =E2=80=93 the f=
eeling
of being let down, not being a priority, the butt of your jokes =E2=80=93 I=
 wold be
there, but this is your choice and you are doing and you will have to take
responsibility for it Again you're just dictating to me where and when I
have to be in order to see my daughters. This is not my role, but I'm going
to quote the following and suggest that you go over it with your lawyer
poste haste. You do not get to schedule my life or my relationship with the
girls or deny any of our rights, no more than I get to decide that suddenly
you will bring the girls to me at 10:45 am one day because it came to mind.
you would never stand for that. This is clearly a double standard but it's
one that again is not about me it's about our daughters.



despite what you wrote in your affidavit you did the same thing with Scott
and I have numerous emails and texts describing why you did that why you
claimed it was necessary, and then why you suddenly changed literally
within weeks from deciding that he was emotionally abusive to Ben and would
have to have less contact with him  to describing him as a cooperative and
I don't know what else yoih said you can look it up but it's clearly not
true and it's not supported by anything you've ever written or said
whether they will admit it or not parents and your family know this as
well. They know who raised our daughters who cared for them and you help
them develop emotionally, you made a dramatic change to custody
arrangements in which I became Scott and that's unacceptable and
questionable as to your thought processes. To suddenly impose those
constraints on me demonstrates a pattern and is unfair and unlawful and
will not stand.



And yes I am extremely disappointed in your parents for not recognizing
this and speaking up for their grandchildren.



Anyhow here's the part that I suggest you review with your lawyer:



In 2017 Master Fortier ordered that "The parties shall continue to have
joint custody...", and "on an interim and without prejudice basis, until
furher agreement of the parties or Order of the court, the father.... shall
have interim supervised access three times per week on a schedule that is
mutually agreed upon by the parties, subject to a mutually agreeable
supervisor being available."



The order from Master Champain from Jam.2018 again orders that I "shall
continue to have interim supervised access with the children, namely.... on
a schedule that is mutually agreed upon by th parties and subject to a
mutually agreeable supervisor being available, until further written agree
by the parties or further Order of the Court."



Then in June of 2018 The Honerable Kearshman accepted our agreement which
did not mention or ammend t


hello earlier orders which make specific Orders about how supervisors are
to be chosen and times decided on the principle of agreeableness, which was
agreed upon by us (even though you knew I was experiencing active
addiction), the order states nothing more about the changes to access to my
daughters save that they shall continue to have primary residence with the
Respondent, Ms. Holmes until further written agreement or Court Order."

So obviously I am seeking a Court Order given you continue to demonestrate
bad faith and perjured yourself in your affidavit.

But since August you decided that you have the right to dictate time, day,
and location without reard for any consideration that I have a job and life
and other responsibilities. And you seek to eensure it does not exceed 4
hours a week.

Be it known that you have dictated  without consideration for my job,
discomfort with your parents, and decided on locatoins that make genuine
parent-child relationships  difficult or impossible.

You have imposed rules that appear to have the intent of alienating me from
my daughters.

It's clear that a motion is required to establishes and enforce any sudden
changes you arbitrarily make, the fact that you do not get to dictate my
schedule or the girls rights, and that you are in breach of standing court
orders. I will be in barrhaven at 3 pm  waiting for the girls and I
sincerely hope that once again you do not deny them the right to see me for
I may be able to bring the emergency motion.

as for this afternoon you know my availability and where I can be so it's
your choice whether you're going to withhold once again my daughters from
me or not.



Following Occam's razor the simplest answer is most likely the right
answer. You worked cooperatively and trusting with me over the summer
because you used me as child care and that's clear because it changed the
minute your parents came back. from a child's perspective that is extremely
sad.



I don't know where you lost your faith or belief in Carl Rogers or any of
the other humanistic psychologists Dennis but I'm extremely disappointed in
you and you are not an appropriate supervisor.
