I've got a few appointments next week, but am free most of the time. Let's m=
ake make plans, near by, if possible. This weekend also works: Saturday afte=
r 12:00, and Sunday anytime. A picnic would be great, or just some time at a=
 park to start.

Char might want her bike. She's close to riding without=20
training wheels! (unless you picked one up - let me know).

I'd love to see the boys too, but we can take that slowly, if they're comfor=
table/interested.=20
