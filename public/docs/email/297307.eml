Sorry Lynda, GMAIL doesn't work from my office, so I have to work around
and sometimes it doesn't!

I didn't get the letter. I completely forgot, to be honest. But I can tell
you, and you can confirm with Dr. Willow if she can't get a letter to you
in time. It looks like the consent form went through. They were very
particular: they need a letter from you requesting the information you
mention above, and it can be faxed to 613-715-5802.

If sent today, she may be able to write the letter before we meet.

Best,
Darryl
