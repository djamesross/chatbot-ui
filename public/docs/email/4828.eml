Sure. Of course. How else can I see my daughters and they see me? If I
don't comply you refuse, so i have no choice. I'm genuinely sorry to hear
about the van, but it's not the first or the last documented case of a last
minute change, restriction, or example showing I cannot make plans and
count on them, and am given the least possible time to prevent an emergency
motion.

If i recall and documents show, your primary concern when i was drinking
was that i was unreliable. That case is closed and passed, and pursuing it
with your lawyer and family members you have a shared interest with and put
far ahead of me, only hurts the girls. But I'll be there, spend an
unreasonably limited amount of time with them, steal myself enough o say
goodbye without crying, and then miss them like crazy until next time.

And then continue to work on the motion you have left as the only option,
when there are others.

Again, i only ask that you let me know you are aware of the alternatives to
court, which has many disadvantages, primarily to the girls. Can you t
least answer that question?

But they don't enjoy that library.  The building as a whole is cold and
unwelcoming, since it wasn't designed for restricted supervised access.
I'll bring activities to do with them upstairs, where there is seating.
Some coloring etc.
