Hello Cynthia,

When picking up the girls please text me rather than coming through the =
side gate, knocking on my door and waiting at the door for the girls. =
The girls will be met at the driveway for drop offs and will come out =
and meet you at your car for pick ups. Unless explicitly invited by me, =
you are not welcome onto the property or into my backyard.

Thank you,

Darryl
