Hi Cynthia,

I hope your RV trip went well, and all had a good time. The girls seemed to
enjoy it. I appreciate your cooperation with Charlotte's birthday this
year, and leaving it to me to make plans at soccer on Sunday. Char's
settled on a soccer ball cake and shopping for some new clothes. My mom
will be with us, so we'll probably go to Bayshore or Rideau, and then eat
a soccer ball. The girls mentioned you have family in town, so would you
prefer this (Saturday) afternoon, or Sunday, when we can pick them up at
lunch and bring them back for Ali's game on Sunday?

Darryl
