Hi,

I received a call from Dr. Fraser=E2=80=99s office this morning letting =
me know that the x-ray showed no signs of damage. The nurse said to =
watch it, and if it gets worse to bring her back. I noticed the tensor =
and Charlotte told me she had seen Dr. Fraser, but she was unclear about =
when, or what was said, and I didn=E2=80=99t know it was serious enough =
to require an x-ray. Can you let me know any more details, if I=E2=80=99m =
missing any? Especially about caring for her ankle. I encouraged her to =
rest it and elevate it when she=E2=80=99s resting, but she didn=E2=80=99t =
know exactly what Dr. Fraser said about the injury, or how it should be =
treated, aside from the tensor bandage. (Usually stretching and =
strengthening after the swelling is gone, if it was a sprain).

It would be helpful to work out some kind of regular update about =
matters relating to health, school,, extracurricular actives, etc., and =
I'm hoping we can figure out how to share information in a way that =
isn=E2=80=99t too onerous. I think a weekly update email, and an =
as-needed messages for more timely or urgent matters, would help us stay =
on the same page, and make decision-making easier. There may be things =
you=E2=80=99d like to know as well as we move forward.

Looking forward to hearing back from you,

Darryl
