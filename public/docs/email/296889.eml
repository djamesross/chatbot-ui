Hi Any,

Apparently Charlotte is sick and has to be kept home this week, so I =
can=E2=80=99t pick her up from school. Whether that=E2=80=99s true or =
not, I have no idea.

This has now been longer than the first time she took them away, and =
she=E2=80=99s clearly trying harder, and is more desperate. It will be =
three weeks this Saturday.

Cynthia=E2=80=99s mom takes care of Alice on Wednesdays (a decision she =
made without consulting me, which was against Sharon=E2=80=99s =
recommendations, and I disagreed). I could pick Alice up Thursday =
morning until Friday afternoon, even if Charlotte is sick. What do you =
think?

Any news in the meantime?=20
