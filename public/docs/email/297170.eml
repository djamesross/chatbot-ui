Yes please!

I=92ll make sure I=92m available at that time. And thank you for getting =
back to me so quickly. I=92ve been getting advice from friends and I=92m =
working on a timeline and making notes right now, so if is there =
anything I can send you or explain or describe to help before we talk =
please let me know.

The latest development is that she offered to let me see them at her =
parents from 2:30-4 pm, while she goes to the house to get stuff. I =
jumped the chance to see the girls (and even considered going and then =
taking them), but then I replied that it would be harder on the girls =
(she told them I was sick, and all the adults would be so stressed and =
tense), but I would pack a bag of things for them for tonight and =
tomorrow, bring my daughters bag and lunch to the school in the morning, =
and that her and I can meet tomorrow to discuss next steps.

I don=92t know what the best course of action is, but I=92m hoping that =
we can get some kind of emergency or temporary order as soon as =
possible.

Darryl
