Hi Cynthia,

I am following up on possibly changing Sunday=E2=80=99s visit to Monday. =
I have to confirm my plans over the holidays, and my mom has to confirm =
her own plans as well. My mom is not available both Christmas Day and =
Boxing Day if Sunday=E2=80=99s visit is moved. She is available =
Christmas Day and Wednesday, Dec. 27, otherwise it will have to be =
Christmas Eve Day and Boxing Day, based on her availability.

Both Thursdays she is only available during the day, 10-5. Over the =
break earlier times are a lot easier for her as she is getting older and =
the drive is very long and on country roads for much of the way.

Kindly let me know if those days work for you or if some need to be =
changed by Tuesday evening so I can confirm my plans and ensure that my =
mom is available as well.
