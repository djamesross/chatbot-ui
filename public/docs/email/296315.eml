 Please call me to advise what is going on. Darryl has the girls in the hom=
e I believe. When he left with Charlotte I advised I will be picking the gi=
rls up at 6 pm at the home. He said "we will see about that".

I'm parked outside the home, the garage is code has changed. He has install=
ed drapes on the front doors so I can't see in. My trust is completely brok=
en. I will be going in at 6pm to pick up the girls.

Hi Any,

I refer to my correspondence of yesterday proposing an interim access sched=
ule. Please advise whether Mr. Ross will be picking up Charlotte and Alice =
this afternoon from school and daycare.

My client informs me that both parties agreed to the visit yesterday evenin=
g and had mentioned it to Charlotte and Alice during their daily phone call=
. Ms. Holmes does not want to disappoint the girls as they are looking forw=
ard to spending time with Mr. Ross. Therefore, she is flexible on the pick =
up and drop off location for this evening.

Unless we receive a different proposal, Ms. Holmes will pick up Alice and C=
harlotte after school and daycare today and Mr. Ross can pick them up from =
her mother's home. Alternatively, Ms. Holmes would be happy to pick up the =
girls from school and daycare and drop them off at the matrimonial home.

Kindly advise on how your client would like to proceed.

Sincerely,
Alison
