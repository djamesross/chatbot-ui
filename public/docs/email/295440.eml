Hi,

I=E2=80=99d like to make plans for Sunday, if possible. I was thinking =
that it would be nice to spend time with them at the park (Regatta). I =
can bring snacks and lunch, and either meet you at the park or pick them =
up, and then walk them back to your place. Would that work for you?

Also, let me know when they=E2=80=99re free tonight, or FaceTime me - =
I=E2=80=99ll be available for the rest of the evening.=20

Darryl=
