This has already gone so far beyond reasonable that I will not accept your
offer, it mearly makes clear that you are imposing your own assessment on
me after CAS has made it clear that there are no restrictions required
anymore and that we are to move forward and work together toward shared
parenting which we did until you arbitrarily took it away. The relapse was
a lie, I have provided medical documentation and more is to come. The
courts do not like to see parents preventing children from being able to
access the other parent, especially after how much cooperation I showed,
how much we cooperated over the summer, and how severe of a restriction you
have imposed on the girls and my parenting rights.

You are continuing to interfere with and prevent me from parenting my
daughters without authority and without justification. If Dennis wants to
sit in the driveway fine, but I spoke to the family and they are not
comfortable with your proposal and neither am I.

I have tried many times to negotiate, mediate, or find some way of settling
this and you have continued to oppose me and to restrict my parenting
rights and to keep my children away from me whenever possible. This is a
reasonable proposal and start. in fact it's far more than reasonable given
how much time I have lost with the girls based on false accusations, lies
and disregard for my parenting rights and the girls.

Either we move forward or my letter stands. It will be your choice whether
you allow this to happen or continue on the path you've chosen.
