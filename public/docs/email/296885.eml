Hi Any,

I had a wonderful time with the girls last night, and a great day with Alice=
. She is so much fun :)

You can see below Cynthia's email to my sister, and my sister's response to b=
oth Cynthia and Heather (although I made it clear to my sister that heather i=
s done with us).=20

I'm considering keeping Cynthia in the dark for a week or two, and just show=
ing up to pick up the girls when it's mine time. Why shouldn't I? Unless it g=
ets dramatic, I think I should continue. (But I always respect your opinion,=
 so if there is a reason, I'll take it seriously.)

I think Cynthia was thrown off. she's used to being the boss, and making acc=
usations, and bossing everyone around. But my sister was with me at pick up,=
 and my step-dad was here until about 3:15, right before I took Ali to the s=
chool, where Cynthia was. Pick up was fine. And if she says otherwise, there=
 are witnesses.=20

Last night and today were so worth it!

Darryl
