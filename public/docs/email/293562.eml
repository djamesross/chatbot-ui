Hi Darryl,

I am glad to know you are feeling better and I can understand that you want
to spend time with the girls.

However,  in order for you to have access to the girls I am going to ask
(again) for proof of health, treatment records and plans to return to work.
The girls have been experiencing some trauma from the disappearance and
reappearance in their lives and I kindly ask that you keep me informed of
your health etc so I can continue to protect the girls safety, health and
emotional well being.

You will need to send all this information to Alison Boyce. Please note she
has changed firms to Mann Lawyers and is away this week but Kate Wright is
managing her file while she is away.

In terms of school, the girls return this week to in person school. They
are very excited and are anxious to meet the teacher and find out which
friends will be in their class. They had a really great August bonding with
school friends and girls they met through camp. I will send you some pics
tmrw and let you know how their first day went.

Cynthia
