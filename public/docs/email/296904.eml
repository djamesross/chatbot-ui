Hi Any,

I=E2=80=99ll be out for a bit, but I should be back by 4:30 pm, if you =
have time to talk.

I haven=E2=80=99t read the letter yet, but my sister has, and she=E2=80=99=
s contacted all of our family, and she says it=E2=80=99s made up - lies.

She=E2=80=99s been emailing and texting several people in my family, =
sometimes multiple times a day. She=E2=80=99s been telling people she =
doesn=E2=80=99t want to work with lawyers, and just wants to work out =
it, which makes me think she=E2=80=99s bluffing.

Her latest email is below:

Hi Darryl,

I see that you texted me about seeing the girls tonight and that you =
won't agree to supervised access.=20

I'm really worried about the safety of the girls in your care and so is =
your family.

I'm waiting to hear back from my lawyer, who will let me know of next =
steps.
