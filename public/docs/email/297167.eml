Also, I've got two audio clips:
- in one she tells her parents 'he won't hurt me'
- in the other she tells her parents they are making her anxious by telling h=
er to take the girls for their safety. She doesn't want to, she says, becaus=
e she's afraid that if she takes the girls (last Thursday when she took boys=
) that i would get mad and a get a lawyer. She wants time to make a plan, to=
 get legal advice, and to 'work this out' with me by talking about it. (I th=
ink she got herself stuck by telling her parents I'm crazy, but not wanting t=
o remove girls from me, and not actually being scared. There are lots of mis=
takes like this.)

I know audio isn't typically accepted, but If there is anyway to include thi=
s let me know.=20
