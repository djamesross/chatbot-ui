Hi Dr. Milstone,

Things have gotten pretty tense here. Cynthia took the boys to her =
parents Thursday night, and was planning to take the girls too. Ben =
overheard us talking and said he was scared. (He was afraid I would come =
back with a gun). So she offered to let him sleep at his grandparents - =
somehow it grew from there to the whole family has to leave - all while =
I was out of the house. We saw Dr. James the next day. She told Cynthia =
that she made a mistake removing the boys and calling her parents. But =
things have been a different sort of tense since them. Based on =
Cynthia=E2=80=99s behaviour and what she=E2=80=99s said, I do believe =
she=E2=80=99s getting ready to leave. She=E2=80=99s either told me =
directly or other people that she thinks I=E2=80=99m unstable, =
depressed/sick, and drinking to the point of addiction.

For now, I would like to try to reduce the tension and provide her with =
some reassurance. We are going to have to work together whatever =
happens. She would like to come to a session with me, and I think it =
could help a little, and probably won=E2=80=99t hurt. It would not, of =
course, be couple=E2=80=99s therapy, which is why I think it should be =
limited. And it would not involve any disputes between her and I. What =
do you think?  Would you mind if she sat in for 10-15 minutes of our =
next session, and asked a few questions? I=E2=80=99m assuming it=E2=80=99l=
l just be the basics, like do you think he=E2=80=99s depressed, has an =
anger problem, has an addiction, etc. I=E2=80=99m fine with you answer =
those question, and any other questions about my general mental state.=20=


I=E2=80=99d appreciate any thoughts you have about the value of this, =
either way.

Thanks,
Darryl
