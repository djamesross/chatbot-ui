Thank you so much Jane I really appreciate it and I do need your help with
these things. I definitely don't want to seem like I'm trying to short you.
I'll get together whatever I can to cover it because it needs to be done
and I really think she's put herself in a bad position. I think the worst
outcome would be that the temporary order would be made more temporary and
changed more quickly and we'd be making progress and I really want to jump
on this so thank you very much. Wednesday would work best for me after 1
pm, I can also do Monday anytime and Tuesday if that's your only
availability I can make it work. Lett me know if that works for you. And
thank you,

Darryl
