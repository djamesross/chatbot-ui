Hi Any,

Just to follow up my last email=E2=80=A6 So Cynthia has been here 7-8 =
times, the first few I left the house, the last few she was supposed to =
take everything she had, but didn=E2=80=99t. One time she came for a few =
pieces of tupperware, and some markers.

She said she doesn=E2=80=99t need anything from the basement (she made a =
point of saying that friends and family have given her all the toys she =
needs), and said she=E2=80=99s done with the kitchen.

Can I tell her that the movers can come in to take the stuff on her =
list, but she can=E2=80=99t? (She can take the boys=E2=80=99 stuff from =
the garage, of course.) I want to set some boundaries with her, but =
don=E2=80=99t want to block her rights.=20
