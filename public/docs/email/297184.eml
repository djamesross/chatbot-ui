Hi Heather,

I am about to move, and in order to do so I need a guarantor to sign a =
photo of my, and write with letterhead simply: I confirm that the person =
in this pictures matches the likeness of the applicant, Darryl Ross, who =
I have known for at least two years.=20

It=E2=80=99s not a recommendation or statement of character, and does =
not mean anything beyond saying he is who he says he is. (And I am me!).

Would you be able to write quick sentence, and sign the back of a photo =
if I brought it to you? My doctor=E2=80=99s office has policy and =
won=E2=80=99t act as guarantors, and the only other person who may =
qualify is unavailable, and I have to have it by Tuesday morning.

Please let me know as soon as possible, so that if you=E2=80=99re not =
comfortable I can try to find someone else.

Thanks,
Darryl=
