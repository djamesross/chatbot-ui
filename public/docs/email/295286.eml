ass=3DMsoNormal>This has gone on far to long, but you are well aware of my =

daughters without cause contrary to our agreement last year in your lawyers=
 office, while I was still suffering addiction and without representation, =
and I have hoped that we would be able to find a way through whatever it is=
 that has triggered your behaviour, which does display a pattern. I remain =
hopeful that we can, but will be in touch with Alison by week=E2=80=99s end=
 if we have not progressed to a reasonable transition plan to return to sha=
red custody. The temporary order in place is no longer applicable and will =
be changed, and if you continue to deny me access and continue to control m=

e seeking costs.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=3DMsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p=
 class=3DMsoNormal>So I am putting forward a reasonable plan to transition =
until the order is changed and made final. I can pick the girls up from the=
 bus tomorrow and spend the evening with them, and bring them back for 7. Y=
ou have no reason, past behaviour or justification to suspect me of trying =
to abduct them, which I would not do for them and which would severely hurt=
 my position if I were foolish enough to do so. So that is no longer a matt=
er of concern, and in fact never was. Friday it would be great to have them=
 spend time with me at the college. Your parents do not and have not superv=
ised for months, so a simple drop off and pick up is sufficient, but if one=
 of them wants to sit somewhere and read a book that is fine. Sunday I have=
 booked tickets to see Frozen II, which we have been talking about since we=
 first saw the trailer and the girls, as you heard this evening, are asking=
 and excited to see it with me. I booked tickets for the 3:15 show, which i=
s usually around the time I see them. However, as part of the transition I =
would like to spend more than just a the limits of the film, picking them u=
p earlier and having lunch with them. I think that=E2=80=99s a reasonable r=
equest, fits with a transition, which they do not seem to want or need but =
is probably good practice. We can agree on a pick up time after the movie, =
perhaps at Indigo.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=3DMsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>=
<p class=3DMsoNormal>In sum, you have been withholding custody from a fully=
&nbsp; recovered father who met every demand you made, and then met the add=
itional demands you added, a father who appears to have been used as child =
care for the summer while your parents were away and you showed no concern,=
 then the girls were suddenly denied a meaningful relationship with an acti=
ve and involved father who has proven long term sobriety, with support from=
 multiple doctors, counsellors and psychiatrists. Oh, and good news, my liv=

 and evidence of abstinence. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=3DMsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp=
