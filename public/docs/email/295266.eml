Hi Cynthia,

I would like to arrange a time to FaceTime with Charlotte and Alice =
before Christmas. I am available tomorrow after the spectacle de Noel, =
and Thursday. Kindly let me know what time works best.

For opening gifts for Christmas I understand that they are not available =
until Boxing Day. Please let me know what time they are available to =
open gifts on FaceTime and I will plan accordingly.

I am waiting for a delivery that will arrive the 24th, and then I am =
away for Christmas. My mom will leave the presents at your door when =
they are wrapped and ready.

I understand that you have asked your neighbour Maureen to supervise =
visits during the holiday. In order to make visits more successful for =
the girls, in particular the first visit, I think it would be a good =
idea for Maureen and I to meet prior to the first visit. Would you ask =
her if she is agreeable to meeting briefly, and ask her to contact me to =
make arrangements?

Thank you,

Darryl=
