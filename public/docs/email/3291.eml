And I hope this time it is true. Please understand the motion has to go
ahead and would be better done cooperatively, as per our agreement.
However, given the amount of time the girls and I have lost based on
innuendo and rumor, while you refused to see, talk, meditate or have
someone mediate on your behalf, you caused the girls confusion, sadness,
and continually directed your actions toward me. You made them more anxious
by telling them I am sick without any medical evidence, complaint, safety
concern, and while avoiding seeing me as much as possible which would have
made clear I have maintained sobriety and my health. I will email Alison
and hope we can avoid an adversarial motion, but a final order will have to
be made, and I hope we can do it cooperatively. To give you some warning,
the first thing I will be seeking is make-up time. I encourage you to speak
to your lawyer about it before making a rash decision. I've come to learn
that judges don't enjoy games, you've made every attempt to make me the
last and priority in their lives, and each and every time you or your
lawyer has informed me that it will be a few days, this was clearly a
tactic, and today is an example. There is nothing more important right now
than establishing a civil regular routine for the girls, yet you have acted
contrary to the principle of maximum contact. I have very little that needs
to be said at the motion should you force it, so my statements will be
short, but my exhibits will not, and I will be requesting affidavits in
addition. All of this stuff about me taking the girls away is for you to
deal with. To date, you are the only one to do so, twice, and without
cause. When there was cause I cooperated.

As a further warning out of concern, because you are the parent of my
daughters and believe it or not I want to see you do well despite your
actions, I don't want to see this turn out worse than it has, so I
encourage you to avoid people who have their own agendas that care nothing
for you and little care for our daughters. You explicitly stated in writing
during the summer that you would have nothing to do with my family matters,
in particular, those financial. That does not appear to have been the case
at all and was stated very directly when I was attempting to tell you that
issues were arising but despite their efforts, child support is primary and
will come first. That was all I had to say, and yet you did not give me the
chance. Without making any accusations, it has the appearance of malicious
intent. I will be raising that issue as well as the hardship caused by your
decision to refuse to let me see my daughters as soon as I found a suitable
place as we agreed, which should have triggered our agreement and enabled
the girls two loving parents. That hurt them, and I may have no choice but
to seek redress if this continues..

I will explain this to Alison but this time it will be up to you to decide
whether or not you would like to make the effort to settle this amicably or
proceed to court. I've stated my position many times but will do so once
again, the girls' interests are paramount, and conflict, not divorce or
separation, is what causes damage.

It was easy enough to pressure and threaten me when I struggled with
addiction. I was vulnerable and scared. That is no longer the case. My
daughters are and will remain my central focus, and they should be yours as
well. Despite your near silence, your actions show are without doubt to the
contrary.

As for today, the last email you sent to your mother was an answer to which
library you were referring to. However, given the level of control and
interference, you have demonstrated it may well have been another order to
me, about where and when I can see my daughters. If you can't see by now
that you are the only parent to break agreements and withhold the children
as well as purger yourself in your initial affidavit, perhaps you could ask
Charlotte and Alice, as opposed to fitting their right to spend time with
me into your schedule. I have asked them so I know the places the would
like to go, but as long as you are using them to force your schedule on us
I will meet them where I can until this ends in by us moving in agreement
back to the shared custody we established this summer, or by order of the
court.

And one last request, which I have made before. After years of hearing you
complain Scott interfered with phone calls, often speaking over Ben and
Sam, answering for them, and curring them short, would you please allow me
to speak to my daughters in a reasonable way, allow them to use the
telephone, and be allowed to call me if they ask. Kindly provide numbers
where I can reach them, and allow them to reach me. That is not an
unreasonable request and would help to show some good faith, and that you
are not trying constantly trying to interfere with their right to develop a
relationship with me independent of you.

Now it's 11, and I have final marks due tomorrow which means a long night.
Are you amenable to the girls spending time with me at the college, or do
you insist I bus back to Barrhaven and then back to the college?

Darryl
