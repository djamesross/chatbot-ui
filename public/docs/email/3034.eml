Hi Cynthia,

I saw that Charlotte and Alice have missed some days this month, =
including today for Alice. Please let me know the reason for their =
absences/lates. Is it related to the recent COVID cases at the school, =
and who is caring for them when they are off?

Please update me on anything else of importance.

Regards,

Darryl=
