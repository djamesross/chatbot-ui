Hi Darryl.

The girls are available tmrw for a half hour in the morning. Anytime
between 930-1130 works. Please email me a time and I will set it up on our
end.

As for present pick up, I will contact Holly directly. My other parents are
visiting outside that day so I just need to coordinate timing.

The girls are free at 1O am on Boxing Day and they are excited to see you!

Yes, I am open arranging supervised visits with Maureen and the girls ,
this is contingent on you providing records of your current treatment plan.
As always the girls safety is my priority and I am open to in person
visitation once I can ensure the girls are safe.

Cynthia
