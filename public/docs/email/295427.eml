There are ample legal documents showing you had sole possession of the =
van for at least 8 moths prior to the offence. I assumed you paid it, =
only to find out that you did not.

Today I started proceedings at the provincial court to have the case =
re-opened. I will present the prosecutor with all of the legal documents =
necessary to show that I had ceased legal ownership of the van when that =
ticket was issued, and  that you were aware I was no longer an owner or =
a driver of the van. =20
