In follow up to your letter, I have a few more specific points to =
address separately, to ensure they are not missed.

First, my record is clear: I have never threatened to withhold the =
children, or used them to bargain. Your client arbitrarily and without =
justification or notice, restricted my access for two weeks, and has for =
shorter periods at other times. I maintained the status quo that has =
developed with her active participation. There were no concerns of =
safety or care, and your client's reaction was simply an attempt to =
force her schedule, and she revealed that following her priority is that =
she maintain control, which she values above and beyond the wellbeing of =
the children.

Second, you are incorrect regarding the police officer. He did not say =
what you claim he said, and did not believe I was breaching the order in =
question. As you know, he refused your clients request to wake and =
remove the children. After a brief conversation he agreed with me, and =
felt no need to check on them, trusting that they were safe and secure, =
and that I would return them as promised. What he did make clear was his =
annoyance that the police were involved at all.

Your accusations are very accurate, unfortunately they describe your =
client=E2=80=99s behaviour exactly. I have asked her for confirmation =
that she will not restrict my access to the girls this weekend in =
retribution and as a punitive measure, and given the level of =
uncertainty and anxiety they are experiencing, I do hope you impress =
upon her the effect that doing so will have. I willingly kept my promise =
to follow the status quo and return them at the agreed upon time. I did =
so even after the trauma she has put me through, and with reasonable =
fear that she is now going to do exactly as you advised me not to: use =
the girls as pawns. I did not. I have asked for conformation that she =
will not.=20

In the past she has frequently and suddenly remembered plans long made =
that interfere with and limit my access on a regular basis, even when =
agreed ahead of time. I do hope such a case does not occur this weekend, =
because it would not be justified.

Needless to say, should she refuse to cooperate, apply unjustifiable =
restrictions on my access, and continue to try to maintain control over =
their relationship with me, l am prepared to bring a motion to ensure an =
equitable schedule is implemented and enforceable. Either way, this =
situation is not in anyone=E2=80=99s interest, most importantly =
Charlotte and Alice=E2=80=99s, and I will be making a motion that =
includes an enforceable schedule, for the interests of the girls.

The accusations made to date are fallacious and obviously out of =
context. Your client has taken them away before without grounds, your =
client has threatened access if I did not agree to unreasonable =
restrictions, and your client  is currently the only person to put =
forward a schedule, without discussion on consultation, and is currently =
trying to force it on three people who do not want its and do not agree =
with it. Note the exactly what I am requesting, exactly how demanding I =
am being: repeatedly, I have requested that we discuss and agree on a =
reasonable schedule, which takes the girls wellbeing and feelings into =
account.

Your client has dictated a schedule. Your client who has previously and =
without grounds refused access to the girls. This of course causes me =
great amounts of anxiety and worry, and she has not responded to my =
request to confirm she will not withhold the girls. This is cruel and =
unusual punishment directed toward me, but it is a choice she is making =
while disregarding the girls. I can live with it, at 5 and 7 they are =
not prepared to handle that stress and uncertainty. So I say back to =
you, Ms. Boyce, to remind the one that has a history of these tactics, =
you must not use our children as a weapon in negation, and to enforce =
the schedule she wants. These may merely be words to you, supplied on =
request and  with receipt of payment, but to me this is real life, this =
my daughters, who deserve far more than this.=20

Again, I ask you before you are out of town tomorrow, to confirm that =
she will not take punitive action by withholding the girls and refusing =
access. I have suggested a reasonable schedule for this weekend given =
the time of year and changes taking place, and it would go a long way to =
reassuring the girls that their mother is not, in fact, trying to keep =
them from their father.
