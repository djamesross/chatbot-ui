f reducing this from high conflict to a disagreement we can work out togethe=
r or in court. In the meantime it simply doesn=E2=80=99t warrant such a dras=
tic change to the girls lives. For now, I=E2=80=99ll agree to pretty much  a=
nything until this is worked out, on a nonprejudicial basis, to maintain nor=
malcy for the girls, and to prevent them from wondering if and when they wil=
l suddenly be taken again. They asked me several times why you were doing th=
is, and as you said after I stopped drinking, they deserve an answer, so the=
y can understand. You insisted on the matter, and I agree that it=E2=80=99s n=
ecessary, in an age appropriate way. But I don=E2=80=99t have an answer, not=

>>=20
>> In the meantime I=E2=80=99m glad you=E2=80=99re keeping them busy. They a=
re excited for horseback riding, school shopping, and I=E2=80=99m glad to he=
ar that Char=E2=80=99s birthday is planned for this year. She=E2=80=99s very=
 excited, and it sounds like a very nice place to have a party. I told them I=
=E2=80=99m excited to hear how it goes, and was very supportive. But that is=
 a short term solution that can=E2=80=99t replace their need for me in their=
 life, and the their ability to feel secure instead of worried that you may o=
r may not let me see them. As I mentioned above I have started to collect th=
e relevant documents, and if you refuse to follow the order for a mutually a=
greed up schedule I will be asking Alison for her availability and filing an=
 emergency motion if access and custody is not reinstated by the following w=
eekend. I have retained legal counsel, add will fight for as long as it take=
s, within the boundaries of the law, but will keep tat separate from the gir=
ls as much as possible. I have no interests in battles or wins, and remain c=
ertain that it is hurting the girls.
>>=20
>> You know that I will follow this through as far as possible and as long a=
s possible because of how strongly and deeply I love them, how attached we h=
ave remained, and because I love spending time with them, and enjoy being th=
eir father. They=E2=80=99re my two favourite people. But as I=E2=80=99ve sai=
d to you and to them, and continue to believe, they will do better, be more s=
ecure, and feel less concern, with two involved parents, rather than one. An=
d because we each add value to their lives, in different ways. And I will co=
ntinue to do everything I can to keep conflict between us separate from them=
, and avoid tactics loke calling the police uneccesarily. I made it clear I w=
as followig the amount of time we agreed to, and retured them without the ne=
ed for drama.
>>=20
>> There are other choices that can be made, which are far better for the gi=
rls. I hope you consider and discuss them. Or if you already have, it would b=
e a simple matter of letting me know, and show this isn=E2=80=99t just about=
 punishing me, or trying to hurt and break me. This has been incredibly upse=
tting, and difficult, and follows the pattens of the first, but at this poin=
t I am about as close to unbreakable as one can get. I=E2=80=99m continuing o=
n and I=E2=80=99m coping, despite how much this hurts. I=E2=80=99m preparing=
 for the move, which as you know I committed to before you told me of your p=
lan. I=E2=80=99m preparing for and looking forward to teaching. I immediatel=
y reached out for support, and am making sure that I am caring for myself th=
rough this period, which I learned to do over the past four years. I will co=
ntinue to make it clear to the girls that I=E2=80=99m strong, healthy, and l=
ook fo to seeing them soon.=20
>>=20
>> Aside from special plans and treats, what are you doing to ensure their c=
onfidence. The have mentioned being afraid to say certain things to you, are=
 afraid they=E2=80=99ll upset you. I trust you=E2=80=99ll do everything you c=
an to reassure them they are safe, I am heath, and the both one the very muc=
h.
>>=20
>> Char wants to talk again after school Today, and I really want to talk to=
 them again and hear about their first day. I find it much easier to tak to t=
hem earlier in the day, before they are tired and when there aren=E2=80=99t a=
 lot of people talking around them. At times it was hard to hear what they w=
ere saying, or they were distracted. Please rrange a time that when I can ta=
lk to them before their getting ready for bed, or all them to call me. They t=
old me that they don=E2=80=99t know how to use the phone, and that it can on=
ly accept incoming calls. I trust you will correct that belief. And as far a=
s phone calls go I=E2=80=99ve told the girls I just want to say hi on a regu=
lar basis. If they want, they can talk my ear off. Or, if they=E2=80=99re bu=
sy, they can say hi dad, going to play, bye! They no there is no pressure on=
 them to talk longer than they feel like it. But keeping contact is importan=
t, and I hope you won=E2=80=99t restrict or make that conditional, especiall=
y  under the current circumstances.

ed for me in their life, and the their ability to feel secure instead of wor=
ried that you may or may not let me see them. As I mentioned above I have st=
arted to collect the relevant documents, and if you refuse to follow the ord=
er for a mutually agreed up schedule I will be asking Alison for her availab=
ility and filing an emergency motion if access and custody is not reinstated=
 by the following weekend. I have retained legal counsel, add will fight for=
 as long as it takes, within the boundaries of the law, but will keep tat se=
parate from the girls as much as possible. I have no interests in battles or=
 wins, and remain certain that it is hurting the girls.</div><div style=3D"m=
