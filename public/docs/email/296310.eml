She should not be removing anything from the home until we have an agreemen=
t on division. I will confirm with Alison tomorrow first thing. I will also=
 let her know that we are meeting in the afternoon and that we will respond=
 to her letter afterwards.

See you tomorrow at 1:30.

Hi Any,

It=92s been eerily quiet, but for reasons that now make sense. I have it on=
 good authority that Cynthia did in fact call the police after we sent our =
letter. However, the police told her that they would not send a cruiser to =
our house, because there is nothing that they can do without a court order.=
 I have also learned - again, on good authority - that she now understands =
that her lies have fallen on=85 I was going to say deaf ears, except that t=
he authorities have listened, as they should have, but that they have decid=
ed that she is simply not credible. In other words, she now appears to know=
 that the jig is up.

Finally, a rumour through the grapevine suggests that she is going to ask f=
or a week-on, week-off schedule. Apparently she is going to ask for this be=
cause, and this is the truly amazing part, she has now entered into a share=
d custody agreement with Scott, the boys=92 father, following a week-on, we=
ek-off schedule (I have yet to confirm this, but am fairly certain based on=
 the source.) As you know, he is the emotionally abusive, possibly sexually=
 abusive, father, that she pulled access away from, a scant 6 months ago (b=
ased on legal advice from Diana Carr). As you and I discussed, it is not in=
 the best interests of our daughters to move to a 7-day rotation. 7 days is=
 an eternity at that age. But, again, this shows Cynthia=92s priorities - s=
he would rather have a nice, neat schedule, with 7 days off for herself, th=
an be a real parent.

As I reflect back on the last 21 days, there are so many highlights. But a =
few things are starting to gain prominence: she told me to give her back th=
e van and the house, and she told me that I will be paying child support. B=
ut only recently we find out that she has secured a rental property, and th=
at she expects me to take on the full costs of our house. And she still wan=
ts the van. I can tell you that I am not in a position to take on the full =
cost of this house. It was more house than we should have bought, and we bo=
ught it because she had to have it.My financial priorities right now are da=
y-to-day expenses, paying for my (excellent) legal services, and establishi=
ng myself in a home that fits the needs of me and the girls. That is it, an=
d I cannot do more.

As always, I await your advice. But based on what=92s happened so far - inc=
luding the fact that she has acted in bad faith, submitted an affidavit ful=
l of
lies, and has never acted in the best interests of the children, I am not i=
n a bargaining mood. Not unless she is willing to make serious concessions.=
 As it stands, I won=92t settle for less than sole custody. And  I will not=
 take over the costs of the house - I just can=92t justify the financial po=
sition it would put me in.

The more that I think about the situation, the more that I want to take a h=
ard-line. It=92s not a matter of punishing her, or getting back at her. She=
=92s already as crazy-hating as she can be about me. But the girls need a c=
lear schedule, a routine, and a parent that is acting in their best interes=
ts. And they need a mom who knows there are limits to how she can treat peo=
ple.

For now, I understand she wants to remove stuff from the house Monday. Do y=
ou think I should stay while she=92s here? (I can do it without getting ups=
et.)

And as for this meeting, is this similar to mediation - can what we say or =
do be used in court?
