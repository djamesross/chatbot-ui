I'm completely within my rights to be limiting access to Charlotte and
Alice as I didn't feel they were safe in your care this weekend. I will
absolutely continue to exercise my right as a parent to ensure that our two
girls are safe with you. So as for today, and going forward, I will be
dropping off Alice to you at the school. But before I release her, I will
be speaking with you to ensure you are sober. If I suspect you are not
sober I will be keeping Alice with me and taking to Charlotte with me. If
you don't agree at that point I have no problem contacting the police and
children's aid. I will be doing this at all the exchanges.

I need to speak to you about my concerns and I want to hear what you have
to say. I'm available Thursday afternoon. Based on what you have to say in
the discussion,  I'll be taking further action.


Cynthia
