I have a very hard time communicating with you, given last events and accusa=
tions. However, I am healthy. I see medical professionals who can confirm th=
is. If you're genuine about moving forward, I will consider sharing them wit=
h you.=20

I just want consistency for them the boys, and for.=20

I'm collecting the documents you asked for, and I will share them with you (=
I do have to check with Any first, and you'd should talk to Alison). But I b=
elieve we can talk about them and what's best with each other. It would save=
 so much time, money, and hurt.

FaceTime and phone calls aren't enough. They need us both, and I think that'=
s 50-50 and won't try for more. =20

It might not seem like it, but I want you to be in the best shape you can be=
 in - as a person, and as a parent. And I want that for myself.=20

 Please make sure they are in bed lights out by 730pm on a school night and t=
