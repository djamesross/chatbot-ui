I=E2=80=99ve been in touch with her, and and am going to follow-up. I =
will FaceTime the girls, and hopefully we can set up a time to meet at =
the park. It=E2=80=99s been hard without a phone, but I=E2=80=99m going =
to try to get one today or tomorrow.=20

I think it might be easier if Dawn supervisor for now, and I can meet =
them during the day, but I do want to work on our relationship so we can =
be around the girls comfortably. I hope that=E2=80=99s something you =
want too.
