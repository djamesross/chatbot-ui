Hi Jane,

Monday at 230 does work, and I will see you then.

I understand about the questions, and don=E2=80=99t expect an answer =
before we meet. I just wanted you to have them so that we can discuss =
when we meet. It was the questions about school and asking for =
information that I was hoping to hear about before, and appreciate.

Should I prepare an outline or description of events for the letter?

Darry
