Thanks. When I open Alice=E2=80=99s, it's only two pages, numbered 1 0f =
4 and 2 of 4. Just want to make sure I saw it all.

I talked to each of them about school, how it=E2=80=99s going, and how =
they=E2=80=99re feeling. I started using a few French words with them in =
January and recently told them that I=E2=80=99m learning French and want =
to practice. Yesterday Alice said she feels shy and embarrassed if she =
doesn=E2=80=99t know what to say so she doesn=E2=80=99t try. I told her =
that I didn=E2=80=99t know any French at her age and that I have a lot =
to learn, and then she was more comfortable and tried to say a few =
things. And Char was really proud to teach us a few phrases. We also =
read a bit in French, and will keep it up. I think once she=E2=80=99s =
comfortable she=E2=80=99ll really catch on. It sounds like that might be =
partly why she=E2=80=99s distracted in class.

I spoke to my manager about the date Char is getting her teeth done and =
I can be at home for a few days following her procedure if she needs it.

I=E2=80=99m trying to set up payments to go automatically from my bank =
account to yours for child care. Can you send me the latest receipts or =
bills you have?  I also need the information for taxes.

And for the chocolates, when is the money due?

Darryl
