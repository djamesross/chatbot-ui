been considering your offer, and can=E2=80=99t decide if it would help =
or hurt. For instance, Todd and my sister have the best intentions, and =
have done much to help, but they have also hurt more than helped. My =
sister will watch the girls, but excludes me. And Todd was never really =
invested in supervising. They decided what I needed to do: they=E2=80=99re=
 working under an outdated model of addiction. They did not trust the =
doctors I have seen, to the point of questioning their credentials and =
experience. Based on their understanding of what I=E2=80=99m going =
through, I believe that they have decided what I have/must do to atone =
(and I think that word is apropos: it=E2=80=99s got moral, behavioural, =
and value intentions). They have a view that is so far from OAARS, or =
anyone I=E2=80=99ve worked with. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I =
strongly doubt my sister will attend. I also think that Todd=E2=80=99s =
wife Cindy is an important part of this, but again I doubt that she=E2=80=99=
d attend. Ditto Kevin, Angie=E2=80=99s husband. My sense is that a =
consensus has been reached, and will =
stand.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I see the ideal outcome from such =
a meeting, but I fear it will lead to more disappointment and judgment, =
which has hurt, a. Deeply. And as a whole literature on psychology =
suggests, the more we disagree, the more we end up with entrenched =
opinions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>While they have tried to help, =
with the best of intentions, and expressed distress, I=E2=80=99ve =
experienced more hurt than help. I keep returning to the professionals: =
they should guide my recovery, not my family. I want love and support =
and help from them, but on my journey, guided by professionals with =
experience. I understand their trust has been broken, but I sense no =
understanding of what I=E2=80=99ve experienced, the trauma, or the need =
to heal. Instead, I was given marching orders, and one best not fall =
from that march.</div><div><br></div><div>But, I believe you know best. =
And I trust Lisa. If you both agree, I defer to your judgement. The only =
concern I have is attendance: if it=E2=80=99s only Todd, or Todd and =
Angie, then I don=E2=80=99t think it will help. Todd is trying, but his =
ability to deal with this is limited (as would mine be). He is there, =
and then not, and then there, and then=E2=80=A6 Angie and Todd both have =
partners, and they have very strong opinions. And again, they talk about =
me, but not too me. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All that said, it =
would be good for them to know what I am doing, who I am seeing, and to =
hear it from you, given that they trust you. Perhaps Cynthia more than =
anyone.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, if you think it best, then I =
do to.</div><div><br></div><div>By the way, I went to OAARS and they are =
going to try to fast track me to see and addiction and trauma =
counsellor. I=E2=80=99ve been doing a lot of reading and research and =
alcohol seems to be a solution to trauma. I am working on that trauma =
and seeing progress. And from what I understand addiction counsellors =
are trained in dealing with trauma too.</div><div><br></div><div>I will =
let you know when I get an appointment, and keep you up tp =
