Hi Darryl,

I left a message for Alison this afternoon and tried her again at around 5:=
00 pm but had no success. I just received this email below.

Let's not pick up the kids from school until I have a chance to connect wit=
h her.

I discussed your case with 2 of my colleagues and we are divided on the iss=
ue of pick up. Ideally we would keep our white gloves.

Subject: Ross v. Holmes - Charlotte's return to school

Dear Ms. Mayer,

I spoke with my client on Friday afternoon<x-apple-data-detectors://0> and =
explained your client=92s concerns regarding Charlotte missing school. Char=
lotte returned to school today and was picked up and dropped off by Ms. Hol=
mes. I hope that this can be seen as Ms. Holmes' intention to work with Mr.=
 Ross to resolve their family issues.

Ms. Holmes respectfully requests that Mr. Ross does not pick up Charlotte f=
rom school until the Society completes their investigation.

I trust that Charlotte=92s return to school will now nullify the need to at=
tend the Procedural Motion on Thursday, November 26th.<x-apple-data-detecto=
rs://2> My client is also in the process of obtaining the disclosure that y=
ou requested in your letter dated November 19, 2015.

Ms. Holmes would still prefer to attend mediation or a four way meeting so =
the parties can arrange an interim parenting agreement for Charlotte and Al=
ice.  Kindly advise whether your client would consent to same.

Sincerely,
Alison
