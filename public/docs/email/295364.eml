Without Prejudice,

Hi Cynthia, I'm writing you ask for clarification for your previous email,
but more importantly to raise a concern that Charlotte shared with me.
Plans were made, they were excited, but to punish me you really punished
them, and that's unjustified. I know you care as much as I do for them, and
that your intent was not to hurt them, but to show concern for your mom,
but Alice was very disappointed and after you left Charlotte shared with me
that she did not feel sick. Rather, she was said she was sad and confused
why you wouldn't let us see the movie or provide an explanation.

Respectfully, because you refuse to talk to to me, I explained to Dennis
the theater is a 2 min walk away, in fact visible from inside chapters, and
it would make the girls so happy. But my question was straightforward: are
there plans to the movie and then brought them back to Chapters. He
indicated that they would be called. I thanked him for his honesty, told
him I would not allow my daughters to experience that, and spent the
remaining time with the girls.

I disagree adamantly with these restrictions, but I can't imagine how the
girls would feel if the police were called and took us out of the theater.

For their sake, kindly reconsider how important it was to them, and why
they don't deserve to be punished.

Darryl
