Hi
Thanks for the update. I am truly impressed with the way you handled this w=
hole situation.
I share your concerns about the principal and daycare provider. I truly bel=
ieve Cynthia discussed her false concerns with them. I will write to Alison=
 to request full disclosure of what she told them and put her on notice tha=
t she has to stop with her defamatory remarks.
I agree that you should tell her to communicate through your lawyer.
Get some rest. This is not over. She will be back tomorrow... I will start =
thinking about our justification for not sending Charlotte to school.

Hi Any,

My girls are sleeping peacefully in their beds. They both went down like an=
gels. I am so happy to have them home again, and I=92m excited for the next=
 three days. We are going to have fun!

I want to give you a re-cap of the day. And what a stressful day it=92s bee=
n...

To start, I am very concerned about the principal=92s behaviour. When I ask=
ed to picked up Charlotte at the front desk, the admistrator immediately fo=
und the principal, who spoke to me before they would call Charlotte. She as=
ked me if anything had changed, or if there was a parenting plan. I told he=
r no, but that I have the same rights as Cynthia, and that either of us can=
 pick her up. She told me that I=92m putting her in a difficult position, a=
nd that she doesn=92t want the school involved. She asked if we should call=
 Cynthia, and I said no, I=92m her parent, and I=92m picking her up. But I =
also told her that we agreed that I would pick Charlotte up this afternoon =
(it was the part after 6 pm that we did not agree on). But lo and behold, n=
ot 5 minutes later Cynthia stormed in the front doors. (And it would take a=
t least 20 minutes to get to the school from her work or from her parent=92=
s home - so she was waiting near-by.) She confronted me and told me that I =
have no right to be there, and that this is not what we agreed on. I didn=
=92t say much, and to be honest I didn=92t feel much either. The principal =
asked Cynthia - not me - if everything was ok, as though Cynthia was in cha=
rge, or in need of help. Oddly, Cynthia told her that it=92s ok, so she bac=
ked off. She did not check with me to see if everything was ok. (She has cl=
early chosen a side.) When I asked her if she called Cynthia, she awkwardly=
 told me that she did. She told me that she did not call to ask Cynthia=92s=
 permission, but only to advise her. After a long pause she offered to do t=
he same for me. I said I don=92t know if that=92s appropriate legally, and =
I don=92t need her to tell me if Cynthia is picking Charlotte up. It just s=
eems totally inappropriate to me, especially after she asked me not to put =
the school in the middle of this, and after I told her that she does not ne=
ed to call Cynthia.

Cynthia told me that she will pick the girls up at 6 pm, and then she walke=
d across the street with us to Alice=92s caregiver (Laura). She had a few w=
ords with Laura, again, like she=92s got more rights than I do, and like La=
ura knows =91the story.=92 She told Laura that it=92s ok that Alice is goin=
g with me - in other words, she gave Laura permission. When we drove off, s=
he followed us back to the house, and parked out front. She was parked ther=
e for at least an hour. She left sometime after 5:00 pm, and returned close=
 to 6:00 pm with someone else in the car (I think it was her step-father, D=
ennis, who helped take stuff the day they were taken, and lied to me about =
them returning).

Then she sent all those texts pretending she didn=92t get your letter. She =
rang the doorbell once, and then left. I=92m so sick of her stories - no pa=
rent would ever do that if they honestly believed their kids were at risk o=
f harm, let alone sexual assault.

She just texted me to let me know it=92s popcorn day at Charlotte=92s schoo=
l, so I need to send a twoonie with her tomorrow. I have no plans to respon=
d to her, unless you suggest otherwise. (Should I at least tell her to send=
 all communications to my lawyer. I don=92t want her to be able to say that=
 I ignored her).

She has gone so overboard with this. I might get a relatively peaceful week=
end - but she isn=92t done yet.

Darryl

I'll just keep going, and bring them Monday morning.

Thank you for staying on top of this today. It's very reassuring.

Alice is down. Now I get to read books to Charlotte, and then sleep soundly=
