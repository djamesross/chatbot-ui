2 pm - thank-you.=20

Agreed: that will be the route we go. I just wanted to try; had hoped, and w=
anted to find a way we could work together. I still hope you consider it, bu=
t I will respect your request, and frankly see the impossibility of the alte=
rnative.=20

But I had to try, for them.

We can both forward all that correspondence to our lawyers.=20

Disclosures - all the documents requested - are coming, by mid-week, I hope.=
=20

And then motions will have to begin, unfortunately.=20
