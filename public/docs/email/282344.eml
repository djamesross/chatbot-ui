Your behaviour this morning was concerning. When you woke up my mom up on th=
e phone at 7 am, you were confused of the day and incoherent, as a result I d=
on't feel the girls are safe in your care and didn't release them. I texted y=
ou all this. You also caused my mom a great deal of distress.=20

Later in the morning you sent me incoherent emails. I am worried about the g=
irls in your care right now.=20

I suspect you are taking too many prescriptions pills and drinking. How many=
 pills did you take today? How is this being monitored? Are you sleeping?

Have you been in contact with Cindy and Todd today?

You just texted me to inform me that you are picking up the girls tomorrow a=
t 9 am and that you didn't do anything today bc you want to reduce conflict.=
 You did not take any responsibility or explain your odd behaviour. I don't w=
ant conflict either Darryl but these past few months have been terribly dist=
ressing  for my family and the girls. You have continued to deny any respons=
ibility of your actions.


As it stands right now I will not hand over the girls to you tomorrow at 9am=
. I'm sorry that this is difficult for you. I need some reassurance that you=
 are ok to have the girls in your care. We will need to meet or please have C=
indy and Todd speak with me.


Cynthia=20
