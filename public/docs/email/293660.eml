I'm writing to inform you that you no longer need to ignore me. I'm
interviewing lawyers, and when I find one with the necessary experience and
knowledge, you will no longer have to work with a self-represented
litigant. You can work directly with the lawyer that I hire. She is not pro
bono and will be my lawyer of record.


To reiterate, I want an amicable settlement, Cynthia is capable of acting
rationally, but if necessary this will go to trial.


If you have a chance remind Cynthia she is in direct violation of a
stay-at-home order. It began six days before they took the kids to a
location without telling me or providing any means of communicating with my
daughters.


Oh, and that I would love to hear from the two most important people in my
life.


Enjoy your weekend,

Darryl
