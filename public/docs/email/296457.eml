Hi Any,

Yes -  I can make anytime from 1:30 pm on. I was just writing you about =
her list. I think she=92ll want to come tomorrow to get her things. =
Should we try to push it back?

And should I try to be here when she picks everything up? As for the =
list itself, there are a few things that I don=92t agree to, including =
the dinning room table and chairs (we have an old set she can take), and =
any art or decorations, because we don=92t want the house to look =
stripped down when we list it.

Darryl
