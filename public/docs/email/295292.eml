Hi Cynthia,

I appreciate the timely response to my questions about our daughters. I =
would only ask for clarification. In relation to whom was the hockey =
team member that you refer to? Please confirm that you were in contact =
with Michelle while away on vacation. Was COVID a concern before or =
after she was brought to the doctor Monday night for concern for strep =
throat? What precautions did you take with respect to Government =
regulations about travel to Cuba during the period in question? Were you =
in regular contact with all care givers during the time?=20

Most importantly will you communicate important information in a timely =
manner moving forward?

I have communicated a number of concerns to Ms. Boyce without =
conformation of acknowledgement, or response. I kindly ask that you =
allow her to respond.

Thank-you,

Darryl
