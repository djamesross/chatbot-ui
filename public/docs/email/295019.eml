I=E2=80=99m sorry to hear that, but I wasn=E2=80=99t drinking, and never =
will when I see the girls. We had a great time playing. And I made sure =
to explain they had to trade candy for the toys. I also got the boys a =
small gift that I thought they=E2=80=99d have fun with.=20

I can understand that they will be hyper vigilant, looking for signs of =
drinking. That=E2=80=99s totally understandable, and will take time to =
overcome, I=E2=80=99m sure.

As for being late, I regret missing time with the girls, but wanted to =
stop to get a bag and tissue paper for the gift I gave your parents. I =
let your mom know I would be late. Otherwise, I=E2=80=99m always on =
time. They=E2=80=99ve helped so much that I wanted to give them =
something, but couldn=E2=80=99t afford much, so I gave them a painting =
that was given to me by the artist, that I thought they would like.

I let Todd know about Sunday=E2=80=99s, starting next week. Thank-you =
for making it work.

Darryl
