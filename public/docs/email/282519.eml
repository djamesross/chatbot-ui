Hi Darryl,
Can you look over the schedule again? I did some calculating of time myself
and came up with a pick/exchange time of Sunday at 330 (when girls are with
me) which coincides with all weekday pick ups from daycare school at 330. I
agree that if you have a sunday family event etc=E2=80=A6 we can work out a=
n
earlier time.

Please let me know after you have looked at the times again.

Cynthia
