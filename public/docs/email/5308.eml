Hi Linda,

I need to know if the email that I received from you originated from you as
a warning or was sent from your account without your knowledge. It's an
important part of the investigation as to whether my email was hacked.

As I tried to say at the park even if they know that a living breathing
person is responding to the email it gives them enough information to start
searching for more information which they can use to then crack your
accounts and do other nefarious things wish I would prefer not to happen at
this point. I've set up a number of things to prevent this unfortunately
that email came through but is easily traceable thankfully.

As a courtesy I would recommend you take a look at protonmail. It's out of
Switzerland highly encrypted and they have a basic free version and a paid
version for a that's about 4 euro a month. Their email is sent over VPN
which makes it much more secure. Some people lose $10,000 and some people
lose $20,000. I cannot afford to lose $20.

At the very least it's highly recommended that you review your Gmail
security settings. They can be raised much higher or much lower and they
can filter out spam and prevent things like this from happening, and to
two-factor authentification if not multi-factor authentication should be
turned on at all times.

If you're not comfortable responding to this email given the situation (the
spamming), please at least text me or just make up a temporary email from
Yahoo or something that you use once to answer the question, or even easier
just text.


Thank you,
Darryl
