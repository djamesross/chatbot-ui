Hi Allison,

I wanted to wait a little longer to see if Cynthia would respond - with =
anything. Something Alice said made me think she might. Instead, =
yesterday for the 4th time in 5 weeks the girls were unavailable for =
FaceTime. Charlotte=E2=80=99s phone was inactive and after texting =
Cynthia Charlotte did FaceTime me from a new number that hadn=E2=80=99t =
been shared with me. When I did talk to her they had just brought their =
Christmas tree in and were decorating exactly during our scheduled =
Thursday time. I talked to Char and we decided Friday would be a better =
day because they always seemed to be busy Thursday. I guess the point is =
that Cynthia=E2=80=99s interference continues and she is unwilling to =
communicate with me, but Charlotte and I are able to make plans.

I added comments to the letter as well as more specific dates. Please =
let me know if this is appropriate:

Good afternoon Alison,

It has been just over five months since the decision of Justice Somji =
(June 24, 2022) regarding parenting time for Mr. Ross, among other =
matters. Mr. Ross=E2=80=99 parenting time with the children has been =
going very well, and I understand that after Mr. Ross provided an update =
on how visits are going Ms. Holmes agreed his parenting time on Sundays =
by an additional two hours.

As contemplated in Justice Somji=E2=80=99s decision, Mr. Ross would like =
to have more parenting time with the children. We do not believe that =
there is a need for his Mr. Ross=E2=80=99 parenting time to continue =
with supervision. There has been no need for reunification =
counselling/therapy because the parenting time and video calls have gone =
well and without incident in terms of the parenting and interactions =
between the children and Mr. Ross, and that both Mr. Ross and Ms. Holmes =
agree that the children are very comfortable and enjoy their time with =
Mr. Ross. I understand that Mr. Ross has provided your client with =
correspondence from his treating physician indicating that he is doing =
well medically.

I understand that Mr. Ross tried to resolve matters directly with your =
client for additional unsupervised time with the children. His efforts, =
however, have not been successful.

Increasing Parenting Time while the children are in school

Please advise whether your client will agree to increase Mr. Ross=E2=80=99=
 parenting time to twice per week after school and all day on the =
weekend. The exact days and times can be finalized shortly, but Mr. Ross =
is proposing the following starting Dec. 11:=20

=C2=B7      Continuing Tuesday's from 4:30 pm - 7:30 pm

=C2=B7      Thursday from 4:30 =E2=80=93 7:30 pm

=C2=B7      Sunday from 10 am =E2=80=93 7:00 pm

Christmas parenting time

Christmas is fast approaching, and Mr. Ross has also tried to have an =
agreement on Christmas parenting time directly with your client which =
has also been unsuccessful. Mr. Ross is proposing to have the children =
as follows:

=C2=B7      Sunday, December 25 from 10am to 7:30 p.m. or Saturday, =
December 24 from 10am to 7:30 p.m. in lieu of the scheduled Sunday visit

Winter Break parenting time

During the break while the children are of school, Mr. Ross is proposing =
to have the children as follows:=20

=C2=B7      Extending Tuesday visits on December 27 and January 3rd to =
12:00pm to 7:30pm.

=C2=B7      As well as an additional visit on Dec 29 and January 5th for =
the day, from 10 am to 6 pm.

=20

May we please have a response by December 7, 2022.
