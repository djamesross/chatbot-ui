Hey,

Sorry for not getting in touch sooner, but this is the first day I'm =
back on my feet. Dr. Fraser said it was most likely viral. It=E2=80=99s =
also my first day back at work, but I=E2=80=99d love to visit with the =
girls tomorrow. I have a meeting from 1:30-2:00, but I can meet before =
or after. I=E2=80=99m still working out a few work meetings later in the =
week, but Thursday or Friday will work for my mom. Should I let your mom =
know to confirm?

Hope you=E2=80=99re well,

Darryl=
