Hi Darryl,

As I previously indicated the missed parenting has been caught up, you have
had extended time all for July and August  with girls, more than 7 hours a
week and that time has been made up from the Saskatoon trip and overnight
camping over well over 7 hours..

If it remains this Tuesday it will be a quick visit as Charlotte needs to
be at practice for 630 pm and they will arrive at your place after school
at 440.

Cynthia
