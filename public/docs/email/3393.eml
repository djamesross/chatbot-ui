Hi Cynthia,

I received an email from Sunlife, and when I checked it I learned the girls
had been to the dentist. I appreciate that you are ensuring the girls see
the dentist so they have healthy teeth. How are their teeth? Any new
cavities? That aside, I had no knowledge they were going to the dentist,
and my regular bank account was in overdraft. This means I cannot pay you
immediately. I will open a new account for money from Sunlife to prevent
this from happening again, and to avoid other problems that may arise I
propose sharing information like this ahead of time. For now, the best I
can do is to pay you back, overtime. I will try to do so as quickly as
possible.

In terms of Alice's glasses, the receipt lists you as the patient, so I
have asked the optometrist to send me a copy of the receipt with Alice's
name. Since you are no longer on my benefits, I can't submit a claim with
your name listed as the patient. I have contacted them, and when it
arrives, I will submit the form and send the money by email transfer.

Darryl
