Hi Darryl,
I'm writing to let you know that because of yesterday's events and your
recent past behavior I'm uncomfortable releasing the girls in your care
this Wednesday. I would like to keep them with me for the time being while
Heather Clark conducts her investigation and we work this out.

I'm open to discuss meeting them in a public place while I'm present or at
the very least having them face time you everyday for the next few days. I
would prefer if we can communicate through e-mail or text and work this out
as best we can without lawyers involved.

If you don't agree to this, please speak with Heather Clark and she can
better explain.

Cynthia
