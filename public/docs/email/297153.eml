The latest exchange, for the record. I decided to respond (as you=E2=80=99=
ll see), but I won=E2=80=99t write anymore. I suspect she=E2=80=99s =
under more and more pressure to resolve the issue, and I hope it =
supports our strategy. But if it comes down to it, I really do want her =
claims to be tested. They will be found to be baseless.

Cyn:
Will you take 3 grand for the van?

Cyn:
That's 3 grand from the savings.

Me:=20
=46rom the savings. But If we pay me $3000 dollars from our savings, =
then I get $1500. Not a great deal on a vehicle that sells for at least =
12-15k. I'm better to refuse, leave it to be sold as part of the =
separation, and net 6-7k.=20

=E2=80=A6 I don't want to make this difficult for you, regardless of =
what's happened, but we need to deal with each other in good faith.

We both need a vehicle, and I will get the van to you as soon as I can, =
but right now I'm just focused on getting access to my kids.=20

Cyn:
We will never get 12 to 15K. I offered 3 grand fair and square. Well I =
guess we can sort that one out when the time comes. Just let me know =
about the van.

Cyn:
You have access to the kids right now, you just have to provide a =
suitable supervisor and a proposed time. As long as I feel the girls are =
safe.This could start this weekend,

Cyn:
So yes please focus on that. The more we can mediate the less $$ goes to =
lawyers. All you need to provide is a suitable supervisor. Why wait =
until Thursday?

Me:
Cyn, you have to know that I will spend all the $$ I have to prove these =
allegations are false and baseless. You know that nothing is more =
important to me than the kids. Not cars, houses, of clothes. Not =
vacations, computers, or speakers.=20

So no, I won't give up ownership of the van for $1500. I'll need =
whatever value I can get to fight this. And when I run out of money I =
will borrow. And when I can't borrow anymore I will beg. There is =
absolutely no substance to your claims. Accusations, yes. And while =
accusations may sway family and friends, they will not hold up in court.=20=


Court demands a standard of evidence that friends and family do not. I =
welcome that evidence. I welcome that judgment. Unbeknownst to me, =
everything I've done as a parent for the past four years has been =
contributing to this case. My cards are down and my hand is played. I =
welcome anyone and everyone who will dig into our lives as deeply as =
they can, and draw their own conclusions about me as a [parent]

I've been forced to chose: I can either accept these accusations and =
conditions, or I can demand that these accusations be tested. I am =
completely confident in my choice - these accusations must be tested, =
and when they are they will be found to be baseless and=E2=80=A6 =
[without] merit.=20

I've been forced to chose That said, I would rather negotiate with you. =
I will happily and hopefully save money, time, and pain, and work this =
out together. Like it or not, we are starting a new relationship as =
parents of Charlotte and Alice, and the better that relationship =
develops, the better the girls will do. The better all of us will do. We =
can work this out, but not if you continue with these allegations. As =
long as you are making these claims and refusing me access to my =
children I will not rest. Nothing is more important to me.=20

Cyn:
Um, I haven't refused access. I've ask if you can arrange a supervised =
visit, as long as I trust the propsed supervisor. Do take it or leave =
it, your choice.

Cyn:
Right now I have 2 girls who should be seeing their dad, Sam crying for =
home and worried about you and Ben who is afraid of you but desperately =
wants you to get well. All this time you are just trying to protect =
yourself. I'm protecting the children. Deep down somewhere you know =
this. So keep using the van, and living in the house. I'll keep my =
babies safe until i'm proven otherwise and I really hope I am wrong =
Darryl. You are living out of fear right now hun, choose love. Face it.

Darryl
