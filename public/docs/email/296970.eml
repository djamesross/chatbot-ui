Not sure if I sent this to you or not (forgive the grammar and spelling =
mistakes), but this has been the issue she=E2=80=99s raised, and it=E2=80=99=
s all she=E2=80=99s got, and I don=E2=80=99t feel like she=E2=80=99s got =
anything. And neither does Sharon, for the record.

She literally damages her children.

I=E2=80=99ll send my financials shortly.=20

Best,

Darryl
