Ok. Thanks again Any.

I=E2=80=99m going to take a break for the night, but here=E2=80=99s what =
I have so far:

Concern for the Children

Ms. Holmes asserts or implies that the drastic actions that she has =
undertaken since November 5 were done to protect our children. However, =
the facts of this case do not support her assertion.

In her affidavit Ms. Holmes makes the following statements, regarding =
the morning of November 6:

 =E2=80=9CAt this time, I was very concerned about Ben=E2=80=99s =
feelings towards Mr. Ross and I did not want to bring my sons back into =
the home=E2=80=9D
 In the morning, =E2=80=9CWhen I spoke to a crisis counselor=E2=80=A6 =
she recommended that I speak with the Children=E2=80=99s Aid society to =
report the incident of Ben feeling distressed. She also recommended that =
I complete an information report with the police=E2=80=9D


During the meeting with Dr. James that afternoon, and being unaware of =
Ms. Holmes plan to leave me, I asked how we were going to help Ben =
understand that there is no reason to feel scared of me. Cynthia told me =
that I would see him again Sunday when he returned from his father=E2=80=99=
s house. We made a plan to speak to him together, to reassure him that I =
was not a threat, and would never harm him or anyone else. It was =
important to me to make him feel comfortable, and to address the issue =
with him. For that reason, I was surprised and caught unaware when Ben =
arrived from school at 2:30 pm. Ben looked uncomfortable when he entered =
the house, and asked where his mom was. I told him that she was running =
errands, and would be back shortly. I then followed Dr. James=E2=80=99 =
advice, and told him that I=E2=80=99m sorry he felt scared the night =
previous, but that I would never hurt him, his mom, or anyone else. =
Unfortunately, I felt that it was not as reassuring as it would have =
been if his mother had been present. Shortly after our conversation he =
called his mom (on speaker phone), who said =E2=80=9Cis Darryl there?=E2=80=
=9D To which Ben said yes. She then asked if =E2=80=9Ceverything is =
ok?=E2=80=9D To which he also said yes. The topic then changed to =
Ben=E2=80=99s plans for the afternoon. At 4:00 pm Sam arrived from =
school as well, and also asked where his mom was. The boys=E2=80=99 =
father arrived to pick them up at approximately 4:30 pm.=20

Ms. Holmes further states, regarding the afternoon of November 6 =
(sometime between 1:30 pm and 4:30 pm.

That afternoon, =E2=80=9CI immediately began thinking about Mr. Ross=E2=80=
=99s strange behavior and his relationship with the girls. =46rom that =
point I was worried about the girls safety=E2=80=9D
Ms. Holmes called the Children=E2=80=99s Aid Society, who =E2=80=9Ctold =
me to stay with my girls and not to leave them alone with Mr. Ross, so I =
followed their advice=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CSince my mother had also raised concerns about Mr. Ross=E2=80=99s=
 behavior I no longer felt the girls were safe with him=E2=80=9D

After leaving me alone at our home to greet the boys upon returning from =
school, Ms. Holmes also asked me to pick up the girls from school at =
3:40 pm, so that she could run errands. It was during that time that she =
claims she spoke to her mother, CAS, and that her concerns for the =
girls=E2=80=99 well-being grew. Between 3:00 pm and 4:41 pm I had the =
following conversation with Ms. Holmes via text messaging:

* Cynthia Holmes  - 3:00:06 PM

 - Hi hun, still running errands. I've got wicked diarhea and running =
hot. How are you?

* Me - 3:14:15 PM

 - Sorry to hear that! I'm tired but ok. Will need an early bed tonight. =
We have some pepto here, but you may want to grab more if you're out.

* Cynthia Holmes  - 4:36:57 PM

 - Just picking up groceries now. Pasta, sauce, bread, =
butter....chips?fruit?

* Me - 4:39:55 PM

 - Kool aid please. Maybe diet pop

* Cynthia Holmes  - 4:41:39 PM

 - Ok hun.

While Ms. Holmes claims that she was =E2=80=9Cworried for the girls =
safety=E2=80=9D, she stopped at the grocery store before returning home =
at 5:15 pm.

During the following two hours, I served dinner, we played with the =
girls, and then Ms. Holmes bathed them while I cleaned up. When bath was =
finished, I took Alice from the bath and brought her into the master =
bedroom, where I put her PJs on, before reading her books and putting =
her to bed. During that time Ms. Holmes helped Charlotte get ready for =
bed. While Ms. Holmes was reading to Charlotte I was upstairs alone with =
Alice for at least 30 minutes.

Because of the events of the night before, I was extremely tired and =
went to bed shortly before 7:30 pm, which is an unusually early time for =
me. During that time Ms. Holmes spent approximately one hour chatting =
casually with her sister, who arrived for a visit shortly before 8:00 =
pm. During that time they were on the main floor of the house. About one =
hour later Cynthia and her sister went downstairs to the rec room, where =
they stayed for about an hour.

Contrary to Ms. Holmes assertion that she followed the advice of the =
Children=E2=80=99s Aid Society, she left me to put Alice down in a =
private room with the door closed, she left me unattended on the same =
floor as both girls for several hours, while she chatted with her =
sister, and then watched a show in the basement, leaving me alone with =
the girls two floors above.

This is not the behavior of a parent who is concerned that her husband =
might be molesting his daughters, and it does not match the account =
given by Ms. Holmes in her affidavit. If Ms. Holmes truly believed that =
I was a threat, she was not acting on her fears, and was not acting in =
the best interests of our children. If, as Ms. Holmes claims, the events =
she described during the summer and fall of 2015 did occur, she would be =
negligent for not reporting them sooner, and not acting on them more =
swiftly.

The Evening of November 5

Ms. Holmes characterization of the evening of November 5 is inaccurate =
and misleading. She describes herself as =E2=80=9Cdistraught, upset and =
confused when I heard Mr. Ross and Ms. Russell=E2=80=99s comments =
regarding taping our conversations=E2=80=9D

Contrary to Ms. Holmes claims that she was distraught, upset and =
confused, she asked to listen to the audio recordings. She was assertive =
and directed her parents and Ben and Sam, helping them to organize their =
things and leave the house.

When my sister arrived, she told us that =E2=80=9Cshe is just going to =
do the dishes and make sure the house is in order for tomorrow =
morning.=E2=80=9D She told that =E2=80=9Cyou guys can go and talk =
somewhere.=E2=80=9D
