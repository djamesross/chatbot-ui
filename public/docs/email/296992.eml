Hello Any,

I hope the rest of your summer went well. I can=E2=80=99t believe it=E2=80=99=
s over - it went so fast!=20

I=E2=80=99m just checking in to see about the motion. I=E2=80=99m back at wo=
rk and planning classes. Do I attend the motion? If so, I=E2=80=99ll need to=
 cover my class that day.=20

I haven=E2=80=99t received Sharon=E2=80=99s report yet, but Cynthia did sign=
 off, so I=E2=80=99ll try to find out when she=E2=80=99ll have it completed.=
 In the meantime, can I do anything to help prepare?=20

I know that Cynthia is working on her financial statement, because I=E2=80=99=
ve received a few angry messages. But in the meantime, I=E2=80=99m sinking f=
inancially. Do you have a sense of how long it will take to finalize the fin=
ancials?=20

Hope all is well,

Darryl=
