We had a consultation and more Xrays with the specialty dentist today, they
recommended choosing between two treatment plans. I will give them both to
you on Thursday, one is oral sedation which is done in their office and she
would have three visits and the other is general anesthetic and they could
perform all the work in one shot in an facility on Woodroofe and Carling
(I've been there with Ben). Both are around $2,000 and I think they would
be mostly covered by our insurance. Could you look into your benefit
coverage?

Also at this office, the insurance goes through in a few days so I had to
pay $196.00 in full. It will go through your insurance first and you should
get a refund in your account within a few days. Can you please send me the
info you receive from your insurer and the payment when you receive it? I
will then send my info to Great West Life.It;s a bit of a pain but I'm glad
their family dentist is automated.


Cheers,
Cynthia
