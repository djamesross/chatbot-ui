That=E2=80=99s a bombshell, and dramatically changes what we agreed to. =
I absolutely do not agree. This shows you have no intention of working =
with me, intend to sideline me, and are treating me like a second-class =
parent.=20

I had restricted access for a period time for a reason. It was explained =
to you very clearly there is no longer a concern or restrictions. Our =
custody arrangement, shared, never changed. Up until this message, you =
are on record in text, email, with CAS, in legal documents, stating you =
are committed to returning to shared access once I am better. Everyone =
involved will be shocked by this.

I got better. I have stayed better. Nothing has happened that justifies =
you deciding you=E2=80=99ll take over sole custody and revoke access =
from me. I enjoyed shared custody for quire while now, and what you =
propose would mean I see them even less next summer than this summer. If =
anything, the opposite could have been argued, but was=E2=80=99t. If you =
noticed something but did not communicate it with me or CAS before right =
now, you were negligent. But there is nothing to justify your decision =
and nothing has happened giving you sole custody.=20

We are moving forward, getting better, strengthening, and then you say =
nope, pull back. No reason.

So, I have to ask, are you ok? In a stable, psychological sense? Are you =
having a particularly hard time with change? I know transition is hard, =
and I will openly say it was harder on me when you planned, lied, and =
illegally stole the children from me. Perhaps you need help with this, =
and I will be understanding. I  say that because the is erratic =
behaviour that has no basis, and goes against the well-being of our =
daughters. Is that your reason?

Alternatively, it should be pointed out that  your email came shortly =
after I raised the issue of finances, and that our financial arrangement =
changed according to our written agreement. You have decided to limit my =
time with the girls and force me to continue to pay money that I no =
longer owe. Is that your reason? To keep me near poverty? It has been =
pointed out to me by CAS, strongly, that this inequality is not normal, =
and seething looks wrong. But I accepted it because I wanted to get to a =
better place. I still do.

You can=E2=80=99t dictate the schedule any longer, or you will need =
serious reason to justify this, which I=E2=80=99ve asked about, but you =
won=E2=80=99t share.=20

Again, I ask that you talk to me, we discuss this, and come up with the =
best schedule for the girls are each of us. That is a reasonable request =
and I don=E2=80=99t understand why you are refusing to work with me, and =
instead make very serious decisions and only then tell me how all of our =
lives are going to be organized. You cannot have assumed I would be ok =
with this. Like I said, everyone involved will be shocked and confused =
by how drastically you are trying to change what was established and =
agreed to.

As adults and parents with shared custody wee have to work out a shared =
schedule. If you insist on all the activities you booked without talking =
to me, I=E2=80=99ll go alone with that, but it that would mean they are =
with me every weekend, Friday after school direct o my place, until =
Monday morning when I=E2=80=99d drop them at school, as well as =
Wednesday I would pick them up at school, and then Thursday until they =
are picked up for activities. That is not an ideal arrangement, but =
it=E2=80=99s better than yours, and will have to happen if you refuse to =
talk to me treat me as a parent.=20

We can work out a schedule that works, if you stop refusing to talk to =
me and we work together.

This has been stressful and shocking, and you=E2=80=99re clearly not =
dropping them off at 1 pm. So I=E2=80=99m going to do errands, but I =
will be here before 5 pm, when you drop them off.
