Hi Alison,

I have concerns about information provided to me to date that deserve =
further discussion and consideration.

The basis upon which Ms. Holmes judged a complete denial of access =
necessary at this particular time is not at all clear. Ms. Holmes wrote =
that it was due to trauma experienced by our daughters on 30 August. =
Kate explained on 2 September that Ms. Holmes will not reconsider her =
decision until certain specific details about treatment are provided to =
Ms. Holmes directly. On 3 September Ms. Holmes wrote that she started =
searching for some individual counselling for Charlotte in August.

I kindly request the name of the person who made the diagnosis of trauma =
for both of our daughters and the reason why that professional did not =
recommend further counselling support for Alice.=20

I also ask for the reason why the urgent decision for a complete denial =
of access was not followed up with urgent action. I have been actively =
engaged in treatment at the same time and know of urgent mental health =
care resources that have been set up during COVID by the City of Ottawa, =
The Royal, our local health network, the provincial government, as well =
as private health care professionals.=20

I have provided further details following Kate=E2=80=99s description of =
Ms. Holmes requests without confirmation of receipt or response. I am =
concerned that proof of sobriety and treatment adherence are not being =
considered, and will not remain the reason provided for the decision to =
deny access. If Ms. Holmes continues to judge it necessary to deny =
access please provide the specific criteria she requires.

I am also very concerned about the timing of this decision. I believe =
that it deprives Charlotte and Alice from the benefits of seeing their =
father become healthy, from learning about the progress of the illness, =
and from feeling reassurance. It also compounds the unnecessary stigma =
associated with alcohol use disorder that affects all family members, =
especially children.

This discussion necessarily includes information about my personal =
health and my private health records. I have ongoing concerns about the =
use of this information beyond the scope of making decisions about the =
well-being of Charlotte and Alice. I ask again that Ms. Holmes maintain =
my privacy and refrain from sharing private information unnecessarily.=20=


There are other concerns as well, but I feel that denying our daughters =
access is the most urgent and deserves timely attention and a reasonable =
agreement to move forward. I propose the following as way to establish =
routine and a basis for moving forward. Pro
For the next two weeks:
Weekly FaceTime on a scheduled day and time that is suitable for =
Charlotte and Alice (not immediately before or after other activities, =
school, etc.)
A weekend visit for not less than two hours at a local park (or indoors =
weather dependent), on a schedule day and time (not immediately before =
or after other activities, school, etc.)
For the following two weeks:
The same as above, maintaining the sane schedule, with an additional =
weekday visit after school (dropped off at my house following the end of =
school) until 7 pm, including dinner, after which I will walk them home =
(at the sidewalk if necessary, and if an adult is present to meet them).
Weeks 3 & 4 are dependent on weeks 1 & 2 being successful.
If after weeks 1, 2, 3 & 4 are successful, the schedule will be =
maintained and the weekend visit will be extended to a half-day (9 am - =
2 pm, or 3 pm - 7 pm)
After this period we agree to discuss the best way to further the access =
schedule for Charlotte and Alice=20
I kindly ask for a response by the 14th of September.

I will provided updated financial information as soon as possible, but =
trust this will not delay the issue of access.

Thank-you,

Darryl Ross.
