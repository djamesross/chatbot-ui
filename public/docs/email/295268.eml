Dear Ms. Boyce,



I=E2=80=99m sending you a copy of the email below that I sent to your clien=
t last
night for your records, and in the event your client has not been fully
transparent with you.



Please also take this as notice that I am requesting your availability by
Friday at 5 pm if Ms. Holmes intends to further entrench her current
position. If she does so I and I have not heard from you the previously
mentioned date I will schedule a motion at the earliest opportunity at my
convenience. However, it remains my hope that your client recognizes what
is at stake in this case and sees fit to bring a motion cooperatively and
in agreement.



But let it be known that I will not agree to meet with you or your client
in your office or without representation at any point, and nor will I agree
to any offers on your part to take sole responsibility for drafting or
submitting any agreeable documents should your client change her mind once
you have consulted with her.



Finally, your client has notified me several times that she spoke to you
days or weeks ago and that you will be in touch with me in days or weeks
with a suggested schedule. While the intent is clearly to put me off, I
don=E2=80=99t particularly matter in this situation. It is my daughters who=
 have
been left confused, uncertain, sad, and ignored. While I respect that you
are busy, and your client has made herself busier by withholding my
children from me, this will move forward on the importance of my daughters
interests and rights.



I look forward to hearing back from you or your client before 3 pm today on
the first steps I have put forward, which are far more conservative than
this situation justifies, and were deemed safe and supported by CAS since
last winter.



Darryl Ross

*Subject: *Final Appeal.



So I=E2=80=99m not sure how this is supposed to work given you have repeate=
dly
refused to talk, mediate or work with me in any way other than through your
lawyer, but I was advised by CAS, who as far as I know you never had a
final closing conversation with, that I should proactively be sharing
information with you. I know the courts don=E2=80=99t want to deal with thi=
s, but
the temporary order will have to be changed, and it would be best if we did
so cooperatively. That is what I ask and hope for. But I am prepared to
move forward without your conversation.



So,

   - It=E2=80=99s been over a year since I have a had any alcohol or drug
   - I have letters detailing successful progress from each of the health
   care providers I worked with that are supportive and encouraging
   - Nothing that your lawyer raised justifies this level of restriction,
   and is by the way inaccurate.
   - I did manage to see Dr. Willows, who as a policy does not see patients
   unless they are acute. It was great to see her and I asked her about the
   recommendation she made when I left the hospital. Given my progress, she
   said it is no longer relevant or applicable, and she was very happy to s=
ee
   me in good health, and does not support any restriction to ability to
   parent.
   - In case you were misled, I have not seen my sister or Kevin in over a
   year, and have had fewer than 4 phone calls with my aunt that lives in
   British Columbia. They have reasons unrelated to my ability to care for =
my
   daughters to disparage me. I would discuss the veracity of their claims
   with your lawyer, and how seriously their statements will be considered.
   - Your parents no longer supervisor, in any capacity. They merely drop
   the girls off and say see you at such and such a time. This is the case
   when my mom is present and, conveniently, at my place of work, where the
   girls enjoyed meeting coworkers and exploring the maker space I am invol=
ved
   with.
   - The girls have begun to ask questions. You have not told them
   anything, which is odd considering how insistent you were to make sure t=
hat
   they were fully informed about my alcohol abuse, as documented by Krystl=
e.
   They will continue to ask questions, because they know I am healthy, hav=
e
   time to care for them and spend with them, want to see them more. I will
   never disparage you to them. They are starting to come to their own
   conclusions.
   - I have yet to hear any safety concerns, which would be the only legal
   grounds for restricting my access.
   - On the advice of Dr. Sharon Francis Harrison I have taken pains, quiet
   literally, to not trigger you. But I do want to express concern. We have=
 an
   agreement, which CAS was party to, and it was going well as documented b=
y
   our texts and emails and time spent over the summer. Nothing changed unt=
il
   you started talking about your discomfort, not the girls, their safety, =
or
   my behaviour. I hope that you are seeking proper help.
   - The motion you are relying on to withhold the girls from me is
   temporary and will be changed. Your cooperation would be appreciated giv=
en
   how strongly the girls are expressing that they want to see me more, mis=
s
   me, and believe shared custody would be best, as we agreed to as well.
   - There is also no reason available for you to claim for yourself sole
   custody and control over the girls and my relationship with them. Again,=
 I
   encourage you to discuss with your lawyer how your decisions and actions
   will be viewed in light of the best interests of the girls.
   - I=E2=80=99m sorry piano didn=E2=80=99t work out tonight, but I=E2=80=
=99m glad they had some
   kind of practice without someone who knows how to play piano. Again, in =
the
   future I would encourage you to try to prioritize in a way that does not
   place me last, in situations that make quality time difficult or
   impossible, completely prevent me from parenting my daughters, are dicta=
ted
   contrary to the standing order, and would please ask once again that you
   arrange times with me rather than telling me when and where and for how
   long and who with I can see my daughters, for the brief transition perio=
d
   while we return to what is best for the girls.



There is now a detailed record demonstrating that you are actively
withholding custody and access from a father you described as great and in
many positive ways, who has been sober for more than 1 year, with whom you
worked with CAS toward a return to shared custody, only to provide a
changing list of justifications for denying what comes down to the girls
rights.



This has gone on far to long, but you are well aware of my financial
situation, having made it worse when you refused me access to my daughters
without cause contrary to our agreement last year in your lawyers office,
while I was still suffering addiction and without representation, and I
have hoped that we would be able to find a way through whatever it is that
has triggered your behaviour, which does display a pattern. I remain
hopeful that we can, but will be in touch with Alison by week=E2=80=99s end=
 if we
have not progressed to a reasonable transition plan to return to shared
custody. The temporary order in place is no longer applicable and will be
changed, and if you continue to deny me access and continue to control my
daughters relationship with me I am prepared to bring a motion and will be
seeking costs.



So I am putting forward a reasonable plan to transition until the order is
changed and made final. I can pick the girls up from the bus tomorrow and
spend the evening with them, and bring them back for 7. You have no reason,
past behaviour or justification to suspect me of trying to abduct them,
which I would not do for them and which would severely hurt my position if
I were foolish enough to do so. So that is no longer a matter of concern,
and in fact never was. Friday it would be great to have them spend time
with me at the college. Your parents do not and have not supervised for
months, so a simple drop off and pick up is sufficient, but if one of them
wants to sit somewhere and read a book that is fine. Sunday I have booked
tickets to see Frozen II, which we have been talking about since we first
saw the trailer and the girls, as you heard this evening, are asking and
excited to see it with me. I booked tickets for the 3:15 show, which is
usually around the time I see them. However, as part of the transition I
would like to spend more than just a the limits of the film, picking them
up earlier and having lunch with them. I think that=E2=80=99s a reasonable =
request,
fits with a transition, which they do not seem to want or need but is
probably good practice. We can agree on a pick up time after the movie,
perhaps at Indigo.



In sum, you have been withholding custody from a fully  recovered father
who met every demand you made, and then met the additional demands you
added, a father who appears to have been used as child care for the summer
while your parents were away and you showed no concern, then the girls were
suddenly denied a meaningful relationship with an active and involved
father who has proven long term sobriety, with support from multiple
doctors, counsellors and psychiatrists. Oh, and good news, my liver enzymes
are back to normal, which is both good from a health perspective and
evidence of abstinence.



I kindly ask your cooperation because this is and will be about our
daughters, and to date you have shown malice, control, and a clear attempt
to alienate me. As you, your parents, and others clearly see, they love,
are comfortable, happy, and flourish with me.



It is time to set aside your feelings toward me and focus on what is most
important.



This is my last appeal.



Darryl

up from the bus tomorrow and spend the evening with them, and bring them ba=
ck
for 7. You have no reason, past behaviour or justification to suspect me of
trying to abduct them, which I would not do for them and which would severe=
ly
hurt my position if I were foolish enough to do so. So that is no longer a
matter of concern, and in fact never was. Friday it would be great to have =
them
spend time with me at the college. Your parents do not and have not supervi=
sed
for months, so a simple drop off and pick up is sufficient, but if one of t=
hem
wants to sit somewhere and read a book that is fine. Sunday I have booked
tickets to see Frozen II, which we have been talking about since we first s=
aw
the trailer and the girls, as you heard this evening, are asking and excite=
d to
see it with me. I booked tickets for the 3:15 show, which is usually around=
 the
time I see them. However, as part of the transition I would like to spend m=
ore
than just a the limits of the film, picking them up earlier and having lunc=
h
with them. I think that=E2=80=99s a reasonable request, fits with a transit=
ion, which
they do not seem to want or need but is probably good practice. We can agre=
e on
a pick up time after the movie, perhaps at Indigo.<span></span></span></p>
