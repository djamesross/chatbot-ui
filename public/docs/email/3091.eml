I left some activities for the girls, and tried to reach them several
times. Please confirm they received the bag I left, and I will Face Time
them tomorrow. We are in the midst of a pandemic  in which people are dying
or becoming very sick. Please keep me up to date on their health, and since
wrongfully denying access to Charlotte and Alice and unilaterally denying
any access it is important to the girls that they see and know I am
healthy, and for me to know the the same. Given your unilateral stance
unsupported by CAS, who made it clear that no restrictions means no
restrictions, and stressed that point, daily contact with the girls is only
to their benefit, and withholding such contact and limiting how long they
would like contact with their father is not in their best interests

I assume you are following Ontario Public Health updates and being
extremely careful. There is no need or justification for visits with
Julianne, for instance.

I will be filing an urgent motion shortly for access based on wrongful
removal and retention of Charlotte and Alice which is detrimental to their
well-being. The full motion will be sent to Ms. Boyce as soon as possible,
and after receiving further legal advice.

Darryl
