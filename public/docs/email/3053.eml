Hi Cynthia,

I=E2=80=99d like to plan a day to make up the time missed Dec. 4 (1.5 =
hours) and yesterday (2 hours). My mom isn=E2=80=99t available later =
this week or Saturday, so would Wednesday after school work?

Also can you let me know why Char and Ali missed school today, and how =
they are doing?

Thank you,

Darryl
