Without prejudice,

Again, I will meet them there only because it is the only way you are
allowing me to see my daughters, disregarding Krystle's assessment, your
agreement, and the entire summer. No supervisor is no necessary. No
interference is justifiable. For a child's psychology, this is unhealthy.

Christmas is coming very soon, and this year it's their time to spend with
me. Christmas eve and morning, and then we can plan a time exchange in the
afternoon.

Let's work out a visit very soon to get it out of the way, and then I hope
that you are able to work collaboratively toward a final order.

This is already so far beyond what is acceptable, please think about the
girls and how much they deserve two loving parents.

Darryl
