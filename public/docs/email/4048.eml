Hi Cynthia,

I did not, in fact, deliver those books, or come near your property. Sadly,
I asked a kind stranger, who through happenstance was returning a favour to
stop them off. The only other time I had something dropped off it was also
someone else. I have not been on or near your property since the day you
invited me in.

Thanks for updating your phone number. I will call at 4 pm.

Those skates were tight then. When I taught them to skate two years ago, I
had mentioned they would need new skates. What size are their feet now? Are
you planning on putting them in skating lessons?

I look forward to FaceTime with them, but really want to see them and don=
=E2=80=99t
understand why you have restricted access. Aside from just seeing them, I
am a teacher and could really benefit them during this time, as well as
spending time with them. For the girls well-being, can you explain the
complete restriction? What is it you feel you need, and why is it in their
best interest to not have their dad in their life in any meaningful way?

Darryl
