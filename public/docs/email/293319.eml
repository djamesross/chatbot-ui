Dear Cynthia,

I can accommodate the earlier soccer practice schedule for this week and =
next week. Once school starts Tuesday's after school until soccer will =
be unreasonably short. Please suggest other days and times that will =
work instead of Tuesday.

While they were away at camp they missed out on a Tuesday visit and a =
Sunday visit, as well as virtual parenting time on Thursday and =
Saturday. To make this up I would like to schedule an additional day =
this week and one next week. Since Charlotte has an appointment Thursday =
I am suggesting:
	- Friday, August 18, 10 am - 5 pm
	- Thursday, August 24, 10 am - 5 pm

Please let me know if this works or if we need to consider other days =
and times. I am flexible on the exact days and times, although my mother =
is less so and needs reasonable notice.

Kindly send me a link to the soccer schedule as soon as it is released =
so that I am able to accommodate.=20

As we both work to comply with the terms of the court order, if there =
are any matters that cannot be reasonably and amicably resolved I think =
it is best to direct any substantive discussions about scheduling, =
changes or areas of disagreement through your lawyer.

Regards,

Darryl
