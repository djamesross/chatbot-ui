>>  Darryl expressed wanting to be more involved with everything with =
the girls and their school. It was discussed and agreed by both parents =
that this could start to resume as of September.
>> Safety Plan:
>> Darryl indicated that although this would not happen but if he had a =
drink while the girls were with him,  he would  notify Cynthia or her =
mother right away and use the phrase "He is sick and cannot have the =
girls right now" which would be the code to he is not doing well or he =
has had a relapse.
>> Darryl offered using a child care person who live across the street =
who could also assistance if the girls needed to go to a safe place in =
case someone in the safety network was not available to come right away. =
Darry and Cynthia agreed they would work out something together to have =
an additional plan.
>> We discussed that the Society no longer has any protection concerns =
