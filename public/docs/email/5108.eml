Hi Linda,

When you come here I=E2=80=99ll be upstairs. If you go to the second floor a=
nd turn right, it=E2=80=99s the door at the end of the hallway (follow the g=
reen butterflies). There is a buzzer beside the door. Press it and they will=
 unlock the door.=20

It=E2=80=99s a nice place, with nice (or sleeping) people. I=E2=80=99d like t=
he show the girls where I=E2=80=99m staying, and then we can go outside. I p=
icked up some bubbles and a ball to play with.=20

I=E2=80=99ll have my phone with me if you need to call or email.=20

Darryl=20
