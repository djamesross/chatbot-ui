The visit went well, both girls did great and the place was very
kid-friendly. Charlotte has a large cavity on one of her molars that has
been giving her some discomfort and she hasa few small cavities that have
just started. The dentist put a temporary filling on and recommended to get
the work done by a Just4Kidz dental on Carling, they can can provide an
oral sedation which will make her feel more comfortable at her age. I will
let you know when they contact us.

Alice has a few tiny holes in her teeth and so they were filled with
sealant and I bring her back in the Spring for another treatment. They also
flagged that Alice has issues with her bridge which has caused some
problems with her breathing while she sleeps. I am taking her Dr. Fraser so
we can get a referral to an EMT for a closer look. I noticed at night she
is really restless and snores with her mouth wide open.

I will keep you posted on on all.

Cynthia
