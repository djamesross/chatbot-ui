Hi,

Sorry it's late, but I wanted to confirm plans with you tomorrow before
making other commitments.

I'm glad you got to meet the family, and see that they are very warm,
welcoming, and I the girls will really flourish.  As you can see we are
they comfortable here, the family is wonderful, and I'm looking forward to
seeing the girls tomorrow.

I do have a few obligations but I'm hoping that we can go back to where we
were with Krystale and at least go from 11 am to 6 pm.

Let me know what you think, I'm open to discussion on times, but we really
need to move forward.
