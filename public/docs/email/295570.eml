I've been trying to send this since at least seven so emailing I will make
sure that I cc Alison, excuse me Miss Boyce. I have already put together a
complete timeline with all of the contradictions, changes, lack of taking
me up on my offers to spend time with me and the girls so that you in your
stomach and your discomfort can begin to feel better which is the basis for
trust and yet you have refused, made arbitrary deions, and ignorefjoint
custody, hiding decisions from me. This works against the principal  of
maximal contact, based on heresay.

The girls have to be central, by law. But I am also in hardship against our
agreement and I will be pursuing renumeration for the costs associated
because there is no basis for your arbitrary decision which came
immediately after CAS closed the case.

Focus on girls: they don't need contradictory messages.  Let's at least
agree on a reasonable explanation until this is settled.  It should not
malign you or me, It should be true, but age appropriate. But it can't be
that I am sick, because they have spent enough time with me that it will
confuse them, having seen me for over 14 months healthy and srtong.
Suggestion: we tell them they  have two loving parents, and parents
sometimes need help working out parentjng arrangements.  Let's work on this
at least together, for their sake. They need stability and consistency, and
neither of us should be bad mouthibg the other. They will pick up on it and
it could have lasting effects they don't deserve. Let's keep the rest
between you and I.

I will be contacting CAS again tomorrow to put an end to the accusations.
Those willl be cleared. Over that I have no doub. If I had a problem I
would let you know, The first people to find out were intent on doing so
and hiding it from you, pushed me  to do so, deflected you and that was
wrong. I will not make that mistake again, hence the distance I have taken
and the accusations that have been made  against, which is hearsay and on
which the is you ans them to prove.  Thakfully facts are reliable.

Please think about this from our daughtera view. They just want time with
their Dad.

Did you really don't want to drag out all the the documents and evidence
starting from perjuring yiurself to the fact that this and last weejend
were set up.

Rather than trying to create cibfkict and that only hurts the girls as
adults we can deal with this, they should not have to. They're confused
about what's going on.

We have a respinsibilility to make their lives better. And we can.

I chose better, but will not give up in them.  I hope you recnsider.

Darryl
