I know it=92s early but I wanted to just put it out there.  So Todd and =
I will
host Christmas 2016 at our place on December 25th.

I am excited about this as for the very first time, I will have a sort =
of
casual Christmas.  We will all eat in the dining room but at different
tables.  We will be together in one room but not at one long table.  I =
think
this will be really cool!  I am calling it my Paris Caf=E9 Christmas!

So, for Karen and Dave and the three girls and partners and for Claire =
and
Graham and the kids and Jessica and Mike, I can accommodate all of you
downstairs in the big room on blow up beds, or foam mattresses as long =
as
you bring sheets and pillows. I also have the bedroom downstairs and the
pull out couch.  Nana gets our bed and we get the spare bedroom!  Cause =
we
are old now.

We will do a $50.00 gift exchange =96 except for kids.  Kids means if =
you have
a job, you=92re not a kid.  That way, nobody spends too much.  Let me =
know if
this doesn=92t work for you.

=20

I will ask for everyone to bring food but it is way too early yet to =
know
what.  I will send a list later on as well as the gift exchange once I =
know
for sure who is coming.

=20

We will have a fantastic time and I =96 or any of you =96 can come up =
with some
fun games.  And if  the weather cooperates, we may be able to snowshoe =
or
walk along the river, or go for a hike. =20

I am really happy to have everyone come here!

=20

Cynthia  =20
