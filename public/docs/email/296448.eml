Hi Any,

Cynthia came back this afternoon to collect a few more things. She =
picked up a her mouthguard (for grinding her teeth - which is valuable), =
but also some tupperware and markers. I had the mouthguard for her. She =
could have taken it and left, or I could have left it in the mailbox. =
But she came in the house to collect the other things, which are not =
valuable. The girls answered the door when she came. I was cooking =
dinner so I returned the kitchen. She came right into the house, and =
into the kitchen, where I was, to collect the tupperware and the =
markers. At one point I had to put food on the stove so walked right =
over behind her (so we were back to back, me facing the stove, her =
facing the island), and she didn=E2=80=99t even flinch. She just kept =
collecting the things she wanted. She was here for 5-6 minutes. As she =
was leaving I raised the issue of selling the house. She had previously =
asked me if I=E2=80=99d consider selling privately to try to save the =
commission. So I told her that if she wanted to do that I=E2=80=99d need =
help getting the house ready, cleaning, and clearing some of our stuff =
out. She said she would help, no problem. She said goodbye to the girls, =
and left.=20

I just wanted to share that, as another example that undermines her =
lies. Also, below I=E2=80=99ve pasted the notes I made last week after =
she came to the house to collect her personal belongings, also for the =
record.

Darryl

Cynthia=E2=80=99s visit to house-

Cynthia came to the house 11 December to pick up personal items. She had =
two people with her (one stayed outside and loaded the car, the other =
helped her carry things out. The person outside was Dennis, her =
step-father, who had previously removed items from our home, and =
directly lied to me about the girls returning on the day they were =
taken).

Cynthia barely engaged with me, beyond a few sarcastic/rude comments =
(for instance, when I opened the door I awkwardly said =E2=80=98hi, =
how=E2=80=99s it going=E2=80=99, to which she replied, very =
sarcastically, =E2=80=98oh, just great!=E2=80=99)

At no point did she tell me what she was taking. She and Joel carried =
stuff down in garbage bags. =46rom what I can tell, she took her =
clothing and personal belongings, as well as:
a soap dispenser from the master bath
a bag with some adult stuff (like personal lubricant) from the master =
bath
decorative pillows
art work made by the kids
At one point I asked her about a snow blower that is currently at her =
parent=E2=80=99s house. It needs to be repaired. She said she doesn=E2=80=99=
t care about it, and that I can =E2=80=98just have it.=E2=80=99=20

She did not let me know when she left - she simply slammed the door =
behind her. As I walked around the house I noticed some garbage bags and =
junk lying around, cupboard doors left open, and lights left on.=20

On a number of occasions she has said that she doesn=E2=80=99t care =
about money or value, she just wants to =E2=80=98get it over with.=E2=80=99=
 Yet she has taken items from the house without telling me, including =
items belonging to the girls (PJs, towels, clothes, white noise machines =
for sleep). When she has come it has been to take a few things - but =
never all of her stuff, or all of what she has been mentioned. I have =
informed her that once we do the division of contents we can make =
arrangements for her to pick up all of the remaining items at once - =
effectively =E2=80=98getting it over with=E2=80=99, but so far she has =
not been cooperative.

When she came last week to take the boys=E2=80=99 items, she also took a =
blanket that was in the garage in bike trailer/stroller. It is a nice, =
warm blanket that I used to keep the girls warm when I walk them to =
school. It was not with the items I moved to the garage for her to take, =
and she did not inform me about it.

The blanket, the soap dispenser - it=E2=80=99s all little stuff, that =
hardly matters. But it=E2=80=99s indicative of her general attitude =
toward me, and her behaviour. She acts as though she feels no need to =
communicate with me, or divide the contents of the house quickly and =
honestly.=20
