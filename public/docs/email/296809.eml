Hi Darryl,

I confirm that the documents were issued by the court and successfully serv=
ed upon Ms Boyce (with only a few minutes to spare)!=20

Also, I received a call from Mr Delaney (Alison's boss). He offered some su=
pervised access. This was at around 4:00 pm. After a heated discussion he w=
ould not offer anything more than supervised access. I told him that our ur=
gent motion materials were on their way. He advised that he would be arguin=
g the motion on Thursday.=20

I will be in touch early next week.=20

Any
