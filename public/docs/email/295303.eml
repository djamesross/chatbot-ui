Hi Cynthia,

I understand your concerns, and I will never put the girls in an unsafe
situation. They were not in the room at the time, and were well taken care
of until you arrived.

It's possible you forgot about birthday plans, but when in front of
everyone Char asked  when you'd be back and when I can celebrate her
birthday with her. Last year was very disappointing, so I was acutely aware
of you saying that you'd be back on her birthday and I can make plans after
that So Char and I made plans for an afternoon. Unfortunately, like last
year, Frozen 2, and other examples, something important has been taken away
from her.

Medically, my health is great. I ride at least an hour a day, often 2-3.
They brought me to the hospital as a precaution, not because they thought
it necessary. I have spoken to our new doctor recently, (Dr. Fraser is
retiring), and the only concern she had was that I may have had a seizure
for an unknown reason, and so she's arranging to book me for an MRI. I will
follow up with her as a matter of prevention, not because there is a
problem.

I propose we meet and discuss moving forward. We can do that with civility
as past examples have shown. I encourage you to include Alison.
Unfortunately I had Rachelle on a limited scope retainer and cannot afford
more of her time, so I am still a self-rep. Maintaining support payments,
and paying you back for the dental work has to take priority. However there
are many alternatives to court that Alison will have explained to you, or
you can ask about if she has not. There are even more that I have been
looking into if you are willing to work on communicating just for the sake
of our daughters.

If we break this down to the simplest issue, we both love and care for the
girls and want what's best for them. Withholding them from me, as well as
my mom who they become very close to, forcing this to return to court, and
the conflict that creates are probably the three worst things that can be
done for the girls. Looking back, I want to be confident that I recognize I
have faults, but have worked to overcome them, and help to raise two
confident, strong women.

So I've made a proposal, and I'd like to hear and to really understand your
concerns so that we can create an access schedule that provides the girls
have the best opportunities, love, and care.

What is your proposal?

Darryl
