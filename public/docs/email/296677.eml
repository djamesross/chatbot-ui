Hi,

I started on a letter but was waiting to hear from you.  Do you want to tal=
k?  I understand if you need the night to digest what Will has told you.  L=
et me know when you are ready to discuss.

I'm really sorry Darryl.

Subject: Update.=20

Hi Any,

I met with Will, and it's not good, but not worse than I expected. He can't=
 share the police report - it's a condition from the crown. I called the Ot=
tawa Police and talked to a constable from the Freedom of Information secti=
on and she said I can't even get the full disclosure. And moreover, she sai=
d Alison probably should not have been given what she got. (She encouraged =
me to send the documents to her supervisor so they can investigate, but I d=
on't care to get someone else in trouble right now.)

So Will can't share the disclosure, but he said - and yelled - the only thi=
ng that matters are the transcripts and plea. If I agree it'll be 2-3 weeks=
, and I can order rush transcripts.=20

As for the plea, the crown has offered the following, which he thinks I sho=
uld accept: I plea to leaving the scene (criminal charge), and driving impa=
ired (criminal charge), I lose my license for 12 months, and I pay a substa=
ntial fine. The crown will drop the refusal to supply a blood sample charge=
. In court they'll read the charges, which includes an eye-witness account =
of me swerving, hitting the car, and leaving. He'll respond that it was a m=
edication mix-up, but I accept responsibility for the two charges.

He does not think we should go to court.=20

It's pretty much what I expected. Or at least not much better, or much wors=
e, than what I imagined.=20

I know this is my case and my life and my girls but I also feel like I let =
you down, and I want to say I'm sorry.=20

Darryl
