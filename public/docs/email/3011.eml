When, given the length and severity of the symptoms, why didn't you notify
me immediately?

Cynthia actively excluding me like this can move this from a return to
shared custody to a judge making decisions we have little control over and
may end up deciding I deserve to make up time or more. You appear to be
trying to alienate me or actually are trying to alienate them from me. That
much is documented. I've been honest with you about returning to shared
custody, and I committed to not having them more than 50% them from you,
but you are showing over and over again that you're trying to exclude me
from their life, control their relationship with me, and interfere with
their ability to develop a relationship with me on their own, which is
essential for proper child development. The courts recognize that. And that
you are the sole parent to refuse access without justification and against
the recommendations of CAS.

The entire summer is evidence in support of my case.

I don't understand why you need to keep this going as a fight. This isn't
about us, and at any time I am ready to talk and I've made suggestions to
do so. I'm only pursuing court because you are giving me no other option,
but conflict is what hurts kids, not divorce or separation, and you have
been driving the charge. I ask that we explore other options not for you,
and not for me, but for the girls. You've given no reason why they should
not start exactly where we left off in the summer, or rather you've given
many contradictory ones and different offers that show this is not about
them, and that you don't have a central concern. Nor support in the form of
hearsay from family members that have not seen me in over a year and have
had no contact with me other than email and their own interests. And you
have not inquired into how I am doing at all, showing that's not your
concern  Again a judge will and can only legally consider the girl's best
interests.

Leaving it to the judge takes it out of our ability to decide, which if it
goes to course I may seek in anyhow in the form of parallel parenting.

Some things have to be met, but withholding the girls tomorrow will make it
worse when we can make it better. Last time cost a huge amount of money,
but I am not seeking remuneration unless necessary. The priority is for our
daughters to reap the benefits that come with two parents. And though
extensively documented, I have no interested in bringing up the pattern of
behavior or abuse of Ben. Neither would do any of us good.

Let the girls come here tomorrow, briefly say hi and be polite, and leave
them for at least as long as you did when CAS was involved and there was a
reason to limit visitation, because this time there is none, and that will
be difficult to explain. Unfortunately, my aunt was dishonest about what I
said, as has you've made sure to prove over the previous months. Doing so
would show that this is not an attempt tp punish me, and, I hope, the stat
of a basic trust we can build on.

But please be aware that this is private property and you don't have the
right to inspect or interrogate the family, including two very nice
children, or my life or interfere with my progress.

Please consider it for the girls, who want this, are confused, and
expressing more and more to me their feelings.

There is a better way. A way that shows how much we both love them.
