Cyn, please put Char back in school. This is way too much time for her =
to miss. I know all this stuff between us is hard, but she needs to be =
in school, with friends, in a familiar environment. We can work this out =
as the adults, but it should be affecting the kids so much. It=E2=80=99s =
barely her third month of school. You=E2=80=99ve got all the power right =
now - I won=E2=80=99t come to your parents=E2=80=99 house, I won=E2=80=99t=
 try to take them from a park, or from school, or from anywhere=E2=80=A6 =
I won=E2=80=99t do any of those things because I can=E2=80=99t and =
won=E2=80=99t do anything to hurt them, or scare them, or confuse them. =
You know I won=E2=80=99t do that to them. Please put her back in school.=
