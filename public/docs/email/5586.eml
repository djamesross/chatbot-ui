That was uncalled for and unjustified. A parent can be tired - especially
one with a sleep disorder - but that gives you no right to refuse me access
to my daughters, breaks plans they had with me, and further confuse them.
And you have no basis or expertise for making such a drastic and arbitrary
decision. I only hope you told them a reasonable explanation, like I had
the flu, because if I had come up you would have caused a confrontation,
hurting them, and they would have known I was fine. You just took more than
half the time you  are currently "allowing" further alienating me from
them, which seems to be your end goal.

You can bring them back, telling the truth. And I am on no medication aside
from sleep medication which I have taken for years and the entire time I
cared for the girls.
