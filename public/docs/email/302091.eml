Hi Allison,

In terms of costs the main points I would want to make is how =
unreasonably Cynthia was. She refused any discussion, my offer to start =
access, and she acted in breech of a court order.=20

The points that I think are important are mostly about unreasonableness =
- she was unlawfully withholding the children and in breech of court =
order. In terms of the claim that I was unreasonable because of =
disclosure I would argue that I was not. I provided virtually all the =
relevant disclosure. What was unreasonable was Cynthia=E2=80=99s broad =
and sweeping demand for irrelevant disclosure which Justice Smoji =
addressed. I made an offer in September to slowly start access which was =
more conservative than the decision. That was ignored and instead I was =
told she would not discuss any issues until she had all of the =
disclosure she wanted.

In terms of disclosure, nothing that I provided was new or informative =
to the issues dealt with in the motion. There was no disclosure that =
changed the outcome. On the other hand, she is still not fully =
cooperating with the decision. She has provided me no information about =
camp or when I will see the girls again. Cynthia has never been honest =
about the amount of disclosure I provided, including Dr. Bowling=E2=80=99s=
 notes. It=E2=80=99s a red herring - she just keeps saying I=E2=80=99m =
not disclosing, without any details or specific. Additionally, Justice =
Smoji addressed the issue of Cynthia not keeping my personal information =
private.=20

In terms of the global view, I believe that I was more successful. I did =
not argue against child support, and in fact in Justice Summers =
endorsement and the agreement we reached prior to the motion I agreed to =
pay the table amounts for my income.

I think Alison Boyce=E2=80=99s costs submission is a fictional reading =
of the decision.

The biggest issue I have is that Cynthia acted in bad faith, this motion =
and the costs were avoidable and the money better spent on Charlotte and =
Alice and reunification therapy, which I don=E2=80=99t know how I will =
afford.=20

I=E2=80=99m also in a very tenuous financial position. The settlement =
that I got from Algonquin which was last minute, but not in my control, =
was to be severance. Instead, a significant amount of it has gone to =
this motion. Cynthia has significantly more money and income. She is =
also doing something on the side - real estate or something.=20

My first visit with the girls went amazingly well, and none of =
Cynthia=E2=80=99s allegations came true. Only her opinion about the =
girls and her statements about trauma or anxiety caused by me are just =
her opinion. She provided no support for her claims because they are not =
true or accurate, and she acted in bad faith by making sure I had no =
access and limited virtual visits so that she could be the only person =
to describe what Charlotte and Alice are experiencing, which it turns =
out is false according to Charlotte=E2=80=99s counsellor.=20

I=E2=80=99m attaching my notes below. It=E2=80=99s a lot, and I=E2=80=99ve=
 probably said most of it before, so I think you can just skim.

Darryl

__________________________________________________________________________=
_____

The responded acted unreasonably and in bad faith. She was found to be =
unlawfully withholding the children, as well as any information about =
them so that her allegations could be tested. She withheld important =
information from the court, she flat out lied about Charlotte=E2=80=99s =
counsellor, and based on my first visit and how well it went she did not =
describe Charlotte=E2=80=99s feelings for me, her happiness in seeing =
me, and her desire to know, reliably, when we will see each other. Even =
after the motion Ms. Holmes has made arranging a visit and the visit =
itself more difficult because of her own personal feelings and emotional =
needs.=20

I am broke, in debt, soon to move from long term disability to searching =
for a new career. I could only afford a lawyer because of the settlement =
I reached with my former employer on Dec. 9, 2021, 6 days before my =
materials were due. I was only able to retain Ms. Lendor on Dec. 15, =
when I luckily received the settlement. The settlement was unexpected =
and the timing was outside of my control. The settlement was to be used =
as severance while I transition to a new career. The legal costs =
associated with Ms. Holmes=E2=80=99s motion have created financial =
uncertainty for me now and when my current income ends. The legal costs =
for this motion, or a significant portion of it, would have been better =
spent in support of our daughters. Instead they were used to deny Ms. =
Holmes request, but also to make clear that she has been in contempt of =
court for the past year.

Ms. Holmes did not take responsibility for her case, her position was =
ruled to be unlawful, and she refused or ignored all my attempts to =
reach a resolution on some or all of the matters in the motion.

Awarding costs to Ms. Holmes, or not awarding costs to me, will have a =
significant impact on me that may affect the children. For example, =
because of Ms. Holmes withholding of the children reunification therapy =
has been ordered, which I view as a success. But it will be a =
significant challenge for me to afford reunification therapy, which is =
in the best interests of the children. The costs of this motion alone =
will make it difficult for me to exercise access of the children.

Unreasonable Behaviour: Ms. Holmes used self-help measures and ignored =
the part of Master Fortier=E2=80=99s Order she didn=E2=80=99t like, =
while relying on that same order to justify her unlawful denial of =
access. The Orders that she sought in this motion were not to change =
custody and access but to validate her decisions and breech of the court =
order. Ms. Holmes denied all access and well as information about our =
daughters including their health, well-being and what has been happening =
in their lives. Ms. Holmes also filed spurious materials that include =
false statements about our daughter=E2=80=99s counselling. Even after =
being provided current medical documents accepts by Justice Smoji, as =
well as being told by Justice Summers to arrange access at the Dec. 20, =
2021 motion, Ms. Holmes maintained an untenable position long after it =
was obvious  that it is untenable. Further, since receiving Justice =
Smoji=E2=80=99s decision Ms. Holmes still refused to cooperate by =
sharing information and making it very difficult to arrange the first =
visit.=20

Offers to Settle: I don=E2=80=99t know if what I wrote counts, but I did =
try to reach some agreement about some of the issues. Child support was =
never my concern, but we reached an agreement about child support prior =
to the Dec. 20 adjournment. I agreed to pay support based on my current =
income.=20

I provided Ms. Holmes with current disclosure as defined in Justice =
Smoji=E2=80=99s decision. I also tried to reach an agreement on the =
matter of access/parenting time, as evidenced in my email from Sept. 2, =
2021. However, as shown in an email from Sept. 2, 2021, from Kate Wright =
acting for Allison Boyce, Ms. Holmes clearly states that it is her =
position that I provide every piece of disclosure that she decided was =
required.=20

Ms. Holmes justified a complete denial of access at her discretion based =
on her own personal opinion that our daughters were traumatized because =
of my absence, which, contrary to her argument, was because she denied =
any parenting time or contact. On Sept. 10, 2021 I emailed Ms. Boyce =
asking for information about the alleged trauma, what treatment they =
were getting, and for more information and clarification. I also asked =
Ms. Holmes to consider a gradual return to parenting time starting with =
virtual visits. My request was denied. In an email sent Sept. 24, 2021 I =
ask that we work together to address as many outstanding issues as we =
can.=20

In response to my request for parenting time, information about our =
daughters, and to address as many issues as we can cooperatively, I =
received a letter from Ms. Boyce detailing Ms. Holmes false allegations =
as well as her terms and conditions. They are in the letter dated =
2021-09-27, where Ms. Holmes sets out the conditions that must be met =
before she will discuss any parenting time. Ms. Holmes clearly ignores =
the existing court order and sets out her own order in which she has =
sole custody and discretion over any parenting time I might have. The =
motion that she brought was not to change decision making and parenting =
time, but to validate what she was already doing.=20

Further, Ms. Holmes position was unreasonable. She demanded disclosure =
that did not exist, was outside the scope of disclosure according to =
Justice Smoji, or was not relevant to parenting time, including =
information regarding my employment status and complete hospital records =
for 'any other incidents.' Disclosure has been used as a red herring. =
Ms. Holmes has never acknowledge the disclosure she received, which =
according to Justice Smoji was significant. Ms. Boyce cites the Order of =
Master Fortier dated October 4, 2017 as justification. It is that same =
Order that states the terms of custody/decision making and =
access/parenting time. Ms. Holmes used the Order and requests for =
nonexistent or vague disclosure, while ignoring the rest of the Order. =
Furthermore, Ms. Holmes did not include Master Fortier=E2=80=99s Order =
in her motion materials, or mention of it.

Ms. Holmes formed and maintained an unreasonable position with respect =
to all matters of parenting time and decision making. For more than 1 =
year she acted with sole custody and discretion over parenting time, =
which consisted of sporadic virtual visits until March of 2021, when she =
denied any form of contact. Importantly to this motion, she has also =
refused to share information about our daughters. She effectively cut me =
out of their life, and made her position clear in the letter from Ms. =
Boyce mentioned above from Sept. 27, 2021.=20

This is not a recent issue. On March 26, 2021 I emailed Ms. Boyce with =
concerns and asked that we find a way to address withholding our =
children and information about them. Ms. Boyce responded stating that =
she would get back to me as soon as she can. She never responded to my =
email. This was normal for Ms. Boyce who would never discuss issues with =
me or respond to emails, other than the few letters that she wrote on =
Ms. Holmes behalf.=20

Throughout 2021 and 2022 so far, Ms. Holmes has refused requests for =
information about our daughters, or delayed sharing information leading =
up to the motion which is acting in bad faith.=20

What little information Ms. Holmes did share was concerning and did not =
fit with her description in her affidavit of our daughters struggles. =
For example, on Nov. 12, 2021, Ms. Holmes emailed me with a few details =
but no information that would allow me to attend our daughters =
activities or sports, which was something Ms. Holmes decided I was not =
allowed to do without her permission, which she never gave. Without =
knowing how my daughters are doing, without being able to communicate =
with them or their caregivers while Ms. Holmes was away, Ms. Holmes made =
it impossible for me or anyone else to make their own assessment for the =
matters of the motion.

All of the claims about our daughters well being come from Cynthia =
alone. I couldn=E2=80=99t prove them false because she hid everything =
she was doing and the girls were doing before, during, and after the =
motions. She effectively created a situation where she could allege =
anything that fit her arguments against me.

=46rom an overall or global perspective I was successful. I just wanted =
parenting time and to know what is happening in my daughters lives. This =
motion changed the situation significantly by denying Ms. Holmes =
validation of her breech of the existing court order.
Child support was not an issue that she tried to discuss with me, and I =
never opposed a change because my focus was entirely on stopping the =
unlawful withholding of our children, and establishing parenting time.

In terms of parental reunification, this is a win for me but it may not =
be necessary now that I have had one in person parenting time. It =
appears that Ms. Holmes grossly exaggerated and in some cases made up =
problems that our daughters were experiencing. By withholding them and =
refusing to share information with me, Ms. Holmes made it impossible for =
me to know and assess our daughters well being, and it is only Ms. =
Holmes personal opinion that was provided to the court.=20

The adjournment was not wasted time. I agreed to pay child support based =
on my income. Ms. Holmes never followed up on the matter that she =
raised. Child support is therefore not a decision that was more =
favourable than our agreement following the motion with Justice Summers, =
so that part of Ms. Holmes motion was already resolved and not a matter =
of conflict. Child support could have been settled reasonably without =
bringing a motion. Ms. Holmes position on this matter is unreasonable.

The costs and time that this motion incurred for me and Ms. Holmes is =
extreme given Ms. Holmes was asking the court to validate her behaviour =
and breech of the existing court order. She chose to take self help =
measures in breech of the court order and did so with impunity. She did =
not bring a motion to change the order for over 1 year.=20

Even after the decision of Justice Smoji, Ms. Holmes has continued to =
act unreasonably in a way that creates more legal costs.

My offer was refused and Ms. Holmes refused any further discussion. She =
provided a list of demands that I must meet before she would being to =
talk about parenting time. She acted contrary to an existing court order =
and made her own, personal order which she enforced by withholding any =
access, in person, virtual or by email.=20

In this context, reasonableness reigns supreme:  unreasonable behavior =
is not limited to offers to settle and include conduct predating the =
commencement of a motion:  Lawson v. Lawson, [2004] O.J. No. 3206 (Sup. =
Ct.).=20

Did I act in an inappropriate way? I don=E2=80=99t think so. I shared =
all or virtually all disclosure, but the actual disclosure I provided =
was never reviewed by the judge, so Ms. Holmes continued to try to make =
this the central issue. Ms. Holmes has never been open and honest about =
what disclosure she received. Further, she misrepresented a piece of =
disclosure I provided from Julie Gingras. Ms. Holmes stated that I sent =
it to her recently when in fact it was provided as soon as it was =
written.

The disclosure I provided did not change the decision or affect the =
outcome of this motion. Nothing was provided that changed the outcome of =
this motion, and what Ms. Holmes has been provided with is beyond her =
expertise to evaluate. It was always a red herring.

She was not honest and forthright with me or the court by choosing not =
to include details about her trips, who took care of our daughters, or =
the nature of the counselling that our oldest daughter was receiving.

Charlotte=E2=80=99s counsellor was not made aware of any of the =
allegations Ms. Holmes made in her affidavit and when informed about the =
decision she stated that she the claims Ms. Holmes made about our =
daughter were not told to her, and were not what she was counselling our =
daughter about.

I believe that I am the successful party on a global basis. Ms. Holmes =
did not need to bring this motion to change support.=20

Ms. Holmes claims that she cannot work with me or come to an agreement =
is unreasonable and found not to be reliable by Justice Smoji. If she =
acted reasonably most or all of the issues in this motion could have =
been resolved, with some compromise.

After the motion, and with Justice Summers directions and endorsement, =
Ms. Holmes refused to organize parenting time after agreeing to do so at =
the December motion.

Furthermore Ms. Holmes continues to act unreasonably by delaying visits =
and ignoring requests for information and disclosure about our =
daughters. Request after request, and she just ignores it.

Par. 106: Shared parenting did occur in the summer of 2019 when Ms. =
Holmes unilaterally and without consultation set her own access schedule =
before deny all contact with our daughters until I complied. In August =
of 2019 support payments should have stopped according to the court =
order, and payments of $300 begin. Ms. Holmes acted unreasonably and =
withheld access another time, which had the effect of making support =
payments continue and it further interfered with my relationship with =
Charlotte and Alice.
