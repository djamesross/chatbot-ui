More text messages, starting with Cynthia this a.m. (I  want to work =
with her as much as possible, but my position remains firm: sole custody =
and the girls with me  60-70% of each week.)

--- Nov 14, 2015 ---
* Cynthia Holmes  - 8:21:51 AM
 - Your last comments resonated with me and I would rather negotiate =
with you too. Would you be willing to meet with Mary or Dr. James so we =
can talk it out together? I'll have to ask my lawyer's advice but the =
more we can work together the better it is for all.

* Cynthia Holmes  - 8:26:31 AM
 - C is doing much better. She was up half the night puking but now is =
in good spirits. We will facetime you tonight. I'll aim for 630. I'll =
need to arrange to pick up some things today.

* Me - 10:06:35 AM
 - I'm glad we can still communicate, and I desperately want to see my =
kids... And I want to work with you - but the conditions are so =
unreasonable that I can't accept them. I spent the entire summer with =
the girls... I spent mornings and evenings and weekends... You left me =
with them that Thursday night, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon. The =
idea that I'm a risk and that they are not safe with me is just not =
true.=20

Taking kids away from a parent, refusing them fair access, removing them =
from their home, from school, and from their routines, is a huge deal, =
and can only be justified in the most extreme cases. This is not one of =
those cases. There is no case here. Court is the only place that will =
really dig into all of this, into our lives, and look at the evidence.

There is a lot to discuss and work out, and doing that with a counsellor =
and in a safe place would be way better than court. But there is no room =
to negotiate when it comes to the kids. Negotiating involves coming to =
agreeable terms about something. We can negotiate about lots of things - =
the house, our savings, the van - but not about our rights to have the =
kids in our lives. The law is clear on that: we both have that right. =
The offer to spend short, limited periods of time with them, with a =
chaperone, would feel artificial, it would be stressful on all of us, =
and it would be confusing for the girls. There is absolutely no reason =
to restrict my rights, and to break the status quo.=20

We can stop this, and work it out together, but it has to start with =
access to the kids. I need to see them, and they need to see me, too.=20

* Me - 10:54:21 AM
 - I'm going to try look for a car this afternoon. I can leave stuff out =
for you or If you'd rather come while I'm out, just let me know. I'll =
probably be out from 1 - 4. .=20

* Me - 12:54:09 PM
 - I'm out now, and will stay out until 4 pm.=20

* Cynthia Holmes  - 3:48:52 PM
 - I'll try tmrw early afternoon. I couldn't get a car.=20
