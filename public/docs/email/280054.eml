Hi Darryl,

I have not heard back from Alison and wanted to get back to you on Xmas as
it's quickly approaching and I know your mom is involved as well. My
apologies for the delay.

For holidays with the girls supervised:
Sunday Dec. 25 noon-730 pm
Tuesday Dec. 27 noon-730pm
Sunday Jan. 1 noon-730 pm
Tuesday, Jan.3 noon-730 pm
Thursday, Jan.5 noon-730 pm

The girls don't have soccer today but do they have church and practice for
the Xmas Eve pageant.

Cheers,

Cynthia
