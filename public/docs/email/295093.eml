I appreciate the small gesture, but once again you are dictating and
restricting my rights and the girls. You are refusing to discuss with me,
and I think it's time to move past that. I am open and flexible, but only
within the limits of our custody agreement.

So after much consideration I have decided the most appropriate option you
have left me is to contniue in good faith with the direction we agreed on,
and the status quo we have established. The sudden change simply will not
work, I won't have housing, and you still haven't taken the girls into
consideration. As of now, the status quo has been about half time, and for
several weeks. Your proposal is still an unjustifiable restriction to my
access which would require a court order to enforce.

You have raised no justifications that can justify this decision, and have
still not asked me, or asked your lawyer to ask me, how sleeping
arrangments will be when I move. You are simply uninformed, and refuse to
ask for information. This shouold have been raised and settled as soon as
you found out I was moving, knowing that I was doing this following our
agreement. The financial implications will leave me without housing.

But the primary concern is the girls. Charlotte sat on my lap for close to
15 minutes, at times sobbing, because she does not want to be forced to see
me less. Neither of them do, and they are excited to move, and are planning
on it. Up until you sent that email, there was no hint to me or the girls.
I had to assume you told them, and was truly shocked that they found out
from me.

I explained none of this is their responsibility or fault, and they aren't
responsible for the decisions made, but I told them they have a right to
express their feelings and wants, deserve to be asked, and that I will take
them seriously. I hope you will do the same when you finally talk to them
about this.

So, I'm emailing you directly so that you'll know that we have plans to go
to the beach today we;re going to keep. It's our last chance this summer,
we promised the girls, and probably won't make it back for swimming
lessons. They both agreed, and want to go to the beach.

I am writing to inform you that I will follow what is now the status quo
and what you, up to know, agreed to, and spend half their time with them,
and no more. I will bring them to swimming lessons *tomorrow*, and expect
you will be there to pick them up. *Please confirm that you will be there
so that I know.*

I will alwats keep my promise not to take the girls from you, which you
also made but did not keep. I  made that promise to the girls as well,
which reassured them because they really don't want either of us to take
them away, and they want to spend half their time with me. We came far
without conflict or problems, until now. And you are taking the most
extreme measures as your first choice. So, until we have a chance to work
out a reasonable schedule, I expect you to cooperate and that I will spend
time with them again no later than 4 days from when you pick them up
tomorrow.

They are 5 & 7, they are worried about who will be in their class, the
first day of school, and other kid worries. This is a big life worry you
should not have put on them suddenly, or at this time. This should not have
been a last minute change that upsets them and causes them to worry. It's
not fair to them. Only you and I can make it easier for them, and I hope
you will think about what is most imoprtant here, so that we can.

Darryl
