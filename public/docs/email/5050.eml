Hello Cynthia,

My family has asked that you please stop communicating and contacting them.

I sent you an email and was very clear that you respect our wishes. I know
you were unclear as you then forwarded it to Buddy and Aunt Kathy saying I
had asked you not to communicate with the family. So I will ask again.

We all speak every day. *What I have asked is that all communication go
through me for now.* I am at home every day and can be the main line of
contact. If you need to communicate about the girls, Darryl, or any family
member they have all elected that the correspondence go directly through me.

Aunt Kathy has not responded to any of your correspondence for a reason.
Please stop contacting her.

Though we appreciate your thoughts for our family members, I ask again that
you please stop reaching out to them.

Holly and George are fine, they are not near the flood area and have not
been affected.

Thank you again for respecting our wishes.

Angie
