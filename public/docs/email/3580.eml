Cynthia, given that you've gone out of your way not to see me, be around
me, or even observe my general comportment, why would you tell the girls
that I am still sick and that's why they can't see me. It's not true. You
have seen medical records to that effect, adressed them and accepted them
with CAS. I am healthy and you said so. And now after not seeing me you
decide to come up with this on your own. And worst of all can cause them
worry and stress. You made it clear how upset you were that the girls were
worried and it caused stress that I was sick, so how could you even think
about putting that on them again? How do you justify that? Based on 3
family members who haven't seen me in over a year? That's hearsay and will
not stand up in court or in common sense. I've gone through all the
documents and I've given Alison everything she's asked for save tax
documents that I will get Monday or Tuesday when CRA is open, and a couple
more medical documents when they come in. I deserve the right to a private
life but I am not trying to hide anything from you and in fact I've made
myself more open especially over the summer.

In the meantime you have punished me in the most extreme way possible.

And then what do you say in a week or two when the documents are alll
collected? That dad was fine I just wasn't ready? He should have been with
you half rhe time but I decided he can't be? How to explain the summer and
then abrupt change? It was wonderful and we spent time at the park we
played we bikes we went in the river we had adventures we did crafts we
kept a toad and let it go - we had a wonderful time and at no point did I
try to keep them from you except for the one time where we agreed on a pick
up and drop off time but you changed your mind which had been happening
frequently and I disagreed. This has clearly never been about the girls or
their well-being or you would have contacted CAS and stayed in contact with
them, and you wouldn't have come up with multiple changing stories. For
what it's worth you're breaking their trust. They see me and they hug me,
they cuddle me, and they just don't want to leave me. Which by the way I
never encourage. I always tell them they have to go and I will see them
again soon, ideally at a set time. To do differently is to make a major
mistake and literally creates anxiety and uncertainty in children  I want
them to trust both of us. They need to be able to make up their own minds
as they grow up, it's vital to child development. And I will do nothing to
undermine their trust in you, even while you do it to me. I want nothing in
my girl's life to be about retribution or battles, wins and losses, between
other people. And I have asked what you've told them and you've kept it
from me for a long time because you told them nothing until very recently
and that's confusing for children. Now you told them that I'm still sick
which is completely untrue, with no evidence other than gossip and innuendo
and that is not the basis for informing our children of their parents. But
I can't control your actions and it will be up to them to decide when
they're older what kind of relationships they want.

I sent your lawyer a very stern letter explaining why you've left me no
other option but to pursue this in court unless you change your course of
action because it is hurting the girls. And you truly are. But it is not
too late. We have so many other options and the worst thing for the girls
is conflict. We should be doing anything we can to reduce the conflict. For
instance I offered and you should have visited my house more often when I
lived near centerpointe, and I don't understand why you didn't That would
have been a great way to build trust. And you are welcome here as long as
you're polite and you're allowing me to move on and progress and not giving
the girls mixed messages. I've tried so hard to avoid conflict but I can't
do it by myself. Court should be avoided whenever possible but not at any
cost. You've clearly been just stringing me along and have had no intention
of setting up a schedule or negotiating with, it was either hope I rekapse
or five up. You'bwen dictating and telling me what I have to take which is
not what we agreed to not in the girl's best interest and just not right.I
I'm going I had with the paperwork in case things don't immediately change.
I have to go ahead with this motion, because unfortunately it's the only
way that things will get changed.

Or we can compromise: you have to acknowledge that I have rights and that
we had an agreement, while I qorked with Sharon to learn to accept the
choices that you make while letting go of my anger towards you.  But I've
been hearing more and more specifically that you're being mean to them when
they say they miss me, they are not comfortable asking to talk to me on the
phone will FaceTime even when they want to, and they do want to talk to me
they're not allowed to use the phone or ask to speak to me and that's
concerning. Not to mention I should have their numbers all numbers in case
of emergencies you withheld those from me from the beginning. We need to
find a way to work it out with as little conflict as possible and so that
the conflict does not affect them. A simple example it may seem trivial to
you is the film Frozen 2. We made plans and the girls were so excited to
see it with me, but because your mum was upset by something I said you
punished all of us by saying we could not go to the movie. and yet we met I
didn't to go directly across from the theatre at the same time it was
playing and I ask Dennis if I walk them over there and walk them back do
you guys plan to call the police and he said yes we do. The police should
not be involved in this, and in fact the courts do not like that in
situations like this. I'm sorry that triggered you but it was important to
the girls and to me that we follow through with our plans and, you had been
changing plans so frequently they were becoming confused to the point where
they were arguing. just like you I love her daughters more than anything in
the world I love spending time with them but I want to be there parent
again and we agreed that's what would happen and I have met every condition
except that new conditions keep a rising along with new accusations and
that only gives rise to conflict. I can't give up the girls and I can't
give up on the girls.

This isn't about control and it would be way better if it were about
compromise and we could make this work quite well with my hours and your
hours and our flexibility. I took it in good faith this Summer that that's
what was happening until suddenly everything changed and I was given no
clear explanation or not least not one that stuck. Just orders  But we have
no need to dwell on the past and can easily leave that behind.

I've avoided being more involved in their lives right now because it does
seem to be a trigger for you but I can't anymore, it's too hard for me and
they need me as well. so I will be visiting the school and I will be
contacting caregivers and I want to be involved in extracurricular
activities. Please share those details with me, keeping in mind I have a
right to because we have legal joint custody so decisions about activities
have to be made between the both of us for now at least. That would be a
good start to building trust and avoiding Court other than to finalize our
motion which we could do cooperatively.

It's me take a long time and I have a lot to learn but I'm committed all
the while hoping that you will pause take a breath you think about the
girls.

Sincerely,

Darry

 you&#39;ve given many contradictory ones and different offers that show th=
