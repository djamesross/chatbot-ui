Dear Cynthia,

Following up on your email below most recently I was unable to reach or =
communicate at all with Charlotte or Alice for scheduled FaceTime calls =
today, July 8, and Thursday, July 6, without prior notice or any =
communication at all. This is an ongoing issue that is impossible to =
address without your cooperation. Unfortunately to date I have only been =
ignored, aside from the email below which denies it happens at all.

If there are more convenient days and times now that it is summer and =
tutoring has ended kindly let me know so that we can change the =
schedule.

With regard to tutoring, I was hoping you could clarify and provide =
further information about your decision to hire a tutor for Charlotte =
for the last few weeks of school during the time that I had been talking =
to them on FaceTime. I value their education and support your decision =
to hire a tutor but the goal and purpose of the session were never clear =
to me and Charlotte didn=E2=80=99t know why she was doing it either.=20

Additionally, the board did not provide the tutoring, free of charge or =
otherwise, according the vice-principal. Please provide additional =
information as this is a matter of education, the purpose and outcome of =
which is unclear, and it appears you were solely responsible for hiring =
and paying the fees and setting the schedule.

Best,

Darryl Ross
