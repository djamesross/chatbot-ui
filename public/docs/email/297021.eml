Hi Any,

I just noticed how the dates worked out with Cynthia=E2=80=99s messages =
- she hasn=E2=80=99t made accusations against me in months, but =
immediately after raising sleeping arrangements and after-school care =
with her - and literally, the evening of the day you sent the letter, =
she sent me the following:

"This past weekend and last night you've sent me some concerning texts, =
threatening to contact Scott about alleged issues and inquiring about my =
financing and going to go through the lawyers to go though cild =
arrangements .My first question is, are you well? Are you taking care of =
yourself? These angry texts are concerning and worrisome. If they =
continue I will be seeking support to reach out to you to make sure your =
mental health is intact."

I=E2=80=99ve pasted the =E2=80=98angry' texts below, for the 7 days =
leading  up to the day the letter was sent below. (I have to admit that =
several are sarcastic, but I=E2=80=99m trying to deal with real issues =
facing our daughters, and she=E2=80=99s basically ignoring me. So rather =
than dealing with the issues that are facing our girls, and =
co-parenting, she makes accusations about me, again! Any, this is =
ridiculous!=20

Darryl Ross:
	Since our last meeting with Sharon I=E2=80=99ve become more  =
concerned about Alice, and how she=E2=80=99s coping. I spoke to Sharon =
about her today and she says there is just too much change for her to =
cope with. She encouraged us to simplify Alice=E2=80=99s life as much as =
we can, and said one of the most important ways to do that is by =
ensuring that she is with you or I as much as possible.  It might be =
harder for us, but in the long run it will be better for them.
	I=E2=80=99m still hopeful that we can work in the best interests =
of the girls. Agreeing to let them stay with me during the summer and =
while you were away was a huge step for us and for them. I assumed you =
would do the same while you=E2=80=99re working additional hours. Any is =
in court this week, so she may not be able to send the relevant =
information, so I=E2=80=99ll let you know, and you can check with your =
lawyer if you need clarification or explanation.

If one of us is unavailable to care for the girls during our scheduled =
time we need to let the other parent know, and the other parent has =
what=E2=80=99s called the right of first refusal. Only if they are =
unavailable, we can then find someone else, whether it=E2=80=99s a =
family member or caretaker. As Any explained it to me, the courts prefer =
for children to be with a parent. This is, of course, best for the =
children. Sharon is saying exactly the same thing.

So, let=E2=80=99s not make this a conflict between you and I. Instead, =
let=E2=80=99s follow the law, professional advice, and do what=E2=80=99s =
best for our daughters. Whenever possible, let=E2=80=99s make sure they =
are with one of us, and help them cope with the change in their lives.

I=E2=80=99m on call for a minor procedure to fix a ligament in my thumb, =
so unfortunately I=E2=80=99m not available tomorrow afternoon. In the =
meantime, please take some time to research the issue or talk to your =
lawyer, so that we can get on track for the girls, for next week.
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Hope your surgery went ok. Alice is at Laura 's. C has her bike=20=

Darryl Ross:
	It did, thanks. I=E2=80=99ll connect with Laura.
	So out of blue Char told me that when Oma picks her up from =
school she'll be taking her to your new house for the first time. I was =
like, that doesn't make sense! I'm sure she'd know that's it's important =
for her to take them there the first time! Let me know your plan, and =
I'll make sure they know what's actually happening.=20
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Girls come true the new place this Sunday! I can bring them or =
you can drop them off. 221 Brambling way
Darryl Ross:
	Cool. I knew that couldn't be the case!
	And since you=E2=80=99re on your on your phone can you let me =
know about the mortgage refund?
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	?
Darryl Ross:
	If you went with ICICI there would be a refund for the penalty =
we paid.
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	I didn't=20
Darryl Ross:
	Oh, that=E2=80=99s too bad. It would have saved a lot. Didn=E2=80=99=
t you go through Deb?
	If you did, she should definitely have let you know!
	I know for both of us every dollar counts, but you=E2=80=99ve =
got a new house, and all of the costs that go along with it. I can ask =
Any to look into it - at the very least, I=E2=80=99m renting, so don=E2=80=
=99t have all the extra costs you do.
	I was really glad you brought sleeping arrangements up with me, =
and asked me what I thought. I realize that=E2=80=99s a big step, and =
thank you for it. Obviously, because of Ali=E2=80=99s age and her =
development, and the fact that she talks about =E2=80=98her fears=E2=80=99=
 now, the closet is not an option - but I know you thought of that =
already. I know that you always felt bad about the boys, and wished they =
could have their own rooms forever. I was going to write sooner, but I =
guess I=E2=80=99ve just been confident that you=E2=80=99d see what=E2=80=99=
s best for the kids, from their perspective. I knew you=E2=80=99d =
realize how the girls would feel if they didn=E2=80=99t even merit a =
room, let alone having one put in the closet! Again, thanks for bringing =
me into the conversation.
	Glad we=E2=80=99re on the same page about the girls so for. Got =
confirmation from Deb tonight, so I=E2=80=99ll get Any to move ahead on =
that. Just got the final batch of records from TD, so hopefully =
financials will done soon (for now, we=E2=80=99ll keep that account =
open, of course). Let me know if there is anything else!
	Also, although you recently told me to post on the Family =
Wizard, I noticed that you haven=E2=80=99t logged onto it in 14 days =
(05/06/2016 5:31 AM). I know it=E2=80=99s hard to log on with busy =
lives, but at a certain point, we have to ask if it=E2=80=99s worth the =
money, right? And since it logs when we use it (apparently to the =
minute!), it seems to show that it is not used on any kind of regular or =
usual basis. Of course, you=E2=80=99re free to keep you=E2=80=99re =
subscription, and log everything into it. In the meantime, my computers =
(and iCloud, & google docs) will continue to keep every email and text =
that I=E2=80=99ve ever sent or received (for the last 7.5 years, +/-). =
I=E2=80=99m confident enough in them to stop paying for the Family =
Wizard, which has not been used in any regular or clear way, to date.
=09
	I swear that=E2=80=99s a mistake, and you should check with them =
- It hasn=E2=80=99t really been 14 days, has it?
	Let's keep drop off the same as usual tomorrow.=20
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Ok, please bring c bike and the helmets.
	It's 221 Brambling, Charlotte knows.
Darryl Ross:
	It's your pick, isn't it?
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	No you drop off and I drop off at 1pm. But I'm happy to pick up =
girls.
Darryl Ross:
	That's ok, I'll drop them off.=20
	I meant to ask you about tomorrow - if you have plans, and what =
time you want to arrange for.=20
	I
	I=E2=80=99d like to take them to Todd and Cindy=E2=80=99s for a =
boat ride, and thought you might need the time to unpack and set-up. =
Either way, let me know!
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	That's ok, why not drop them off afterwards?
Darryl Ross:
	Awesome - they are very excited! I don=E2=80=99t know if Char =
has mentioned Amelia (Cindy=E2=80=99s sister=E2=80=99s daughter), but =
they=E2=80=99ll be there tomorrow too, so Char is extra excited. I=E2=80=99=
ll put Ali down for an early nap, so we can get there for a boat ride. =
(By the way, Ali=E2=80=99s been up very early the last few days - like =
5:30).
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Oh great re. Alice .When dos Charlotte take an interest in =
Amelia? They were not close before=20
Darryl Ross:
	No, but when we were at the chalet Amelia spent some time with =
her and helped her colour, so Char was enamored. She really looks up to =
the older kids.=20
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	When can I expect the girls today?
	Can you oh pls bring their suits and life jackets?
Darryl Ross:
	We're just getting ready to head out on the boat now.  I can =
feed them dinner after and bring them home after. Does that work?
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Wow, I think we got our messages crossed. I thought you were =
dropping off after ali early nap. It might make sense to meet in man =
prick as Ben has a game so we will watch a bit. Does 530 work?
Darryl Ross:
	That works. Just let me know where.=20
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Will they have eaten?
	Centennial  park in manotick. Turn left on beaver wood until you =
hit the centre community arena. I'll be parked beside the centre o. The =
far side I front of the tennis s courts
Darryl Ross:
	We're eating now, just about to leave!
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Ok tell me when you are 5 mins away
Darryl Ross:
	We're on our way - to soccer place.=20
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Ok
Darryl Ross:
	Just dropped phone in your mailbox! (7:45 pm)
	Tomorrow I'm free in the afternoon and want to pick  the girls =
up and take care of them until you're done work - let me know what works =
for you!
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Charlotte back pack and lunch ? Can you drop off at school this =
morning?=20
	As well as hats, it's going to be another hot one.
Darryl Ross:
	Does she need food, or just back pack and lunch kit?
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	She has a cold lunch so if you want to heat up some pasta in her =
thermos with a spoon that would help
Darryl Ross:
	I dropped off pasta for Char today after Emilie told me she =
didn't have enough, so all worked out! Didn't her from you about the =
girls. Please let me know who is taking care of them right now.=20
	In terms of soccer, since Char said she wants the same league as =
Nora, I can=E2=80=99t see any reason why we would chose a different one =
- so I=E2=80=99m in support! (And I we=E2=80=99re on the same page, if =
it=E2=80=99s not a health or safety issue, I will always support their =
choice - unless their is an important reason not to!)
	Never heard back from you today - I=E2=80=99m assuming Oma =
picked them up, so they can play with their brothers? Please let me =
know, so I know how they=E2=80=99re doing!
+1 (613) 863-4494:
	Girls are great.=20
Darryl Ross:
	Great! And clearly you didn=E2=80=99t have the chance to read my =
text! I know, it=E2=80=99s hard sometimes. So, they spent time with your =
mom and their brothers?
=09
I just hope to know what they=E2=80=99re up to, and who=E2=80=99s taking =
care of them, given I=E2=80=99m a custodial parent!
	=F0=9F=98=8A\
=09
And I really do appreciate the update - it=E2=80=99s great to get so =
much information about our daughters!
=09
It's so great that Scott cam pick the boys up now, considering that =
about 8 months ago you took access away from him because he was =
emotionally abusive, and touching Sam in inappropriate ways.=20
=09
Big advance Scott! Not sure why I can't care for our daughters, =
considering you decided, on your own and without notifying me, that you =
won't follow through with Sharon, because you think Char is doing =
better....=20
=09
Still unpacking... Came across a bunch of financial/legal documents, =
including an old T4 from Scott, your old separation agreement... the =
letters from the executor of Georgette=E2=80=99s will - don=E2=80=99t =
want to give the wrong documents to the wrong person! Hopefully you=E2=80=99=
ll get back to me...?=20
=09
No worries- I know you have all the kids, so I can try to separate =
things out as best I can and let Scott know.=20
=09
Dr. Allen=E2=80=99s office just called to say the boys have an =
appointment at 2 pm. I gave them your cell number.
=09
Alice has diaper rash, again.=20
=09
So earlier today Charlotte told me that her and Ali both sleep in your =
closet, in the same bed. I was like, that can=E2=80=99t be! Right...?
=09
Yes, the girls and I are at Regatta park!
=09
So Ali=E2=80=99s diaper rash is gone, again. Since it goes away so =
quickly and easily, I don=E2=80=99t think, for the last 3-4 weeks, that =
it=E2=80=99s been yeast. I understand it can be hard to change her at =
times, but a song and some gentle words calm her, and she really does =
understand the importance of a good change, when calmly explained to =
her.
	I=E2=80=99ve also talked to Laura, and she=E2=80=99s on board =
too. I really hope not to see un-wiped poop and fresh diaper rash, going =
forward.
	Tomorrow is Friday so Ali will be with me for the day, as we =
both agreed. Let me know about Char and pick up.=20
