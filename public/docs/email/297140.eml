With regard to her relationship to Ben and Sam=E2=80=99s father, an =
email from Cynthia to Scott, January 18, 2015, approximately 5 months =
prior to further reducing his access to the boys:

Hi,

I feel more comfortable communicating about this subject about the boys =
as I'm worried about your reaction. The reason I don't want you to spend =
more time  with the boys is I'm concerned for the boys' emotional well =
being. You don't treat Ben well, you constantly criticize his actions =
and behaviour, you compare him to Sam which incredible hard for both the =
children and you blame him for your fights. If Ben responds negatively =
you lash out in anger. This has damaging effects on both children. Ben =
suffers from low self esteem, anxiety and depression, I want him to get =
better, I know you do too. Sam also is incredibly anxious and has a hard =
time expressing his feelings and blocks things that are hard to handle.

I don't think you mean to hurt the boys, I think this is the way you =
know how to parent. I know that you love the boys deeply, I see that. I =
do hope you can get some help managing your own feelings and that we can =
work together on this but for now I think the current arrangement is all =
I'm comfortable with.

CMH

=46rom Scott, April 22, 2015:

I don't really care that you are not comfortable - you have given no =
explanation or reason - I could say the same thing to you - that I'm not =
comfortable with you having my boys as much as you do !!

As for the Tuesday nights you offered to help when I was in a pinch with =
vehicles - would you like me to send you your email back to you ?=20

And I had sent subsequent emails stating that I was working on it - and =
then 1 stating that I had resolved the car issue ! It is so funny how =
you latched on to the very first email ! Ha ... You are really showing =
your true colors.

Have a great day=20
