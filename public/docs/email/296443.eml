Hi Any,

Please see the email below that the real estate agent sent to Alison. I find=
 it very concerning. I haven't spoken to her about it yet, but she is not co=
rrect about my assumptions, and does not seem to be working in my interests.=
 She seems to be intent on making this deal work regardless of my concerns. I=
t's also worth noting the the couple has apparently agreed to go to 535k, wh=
ich at this point I still think is low. I don't know why Jenna has refused t=
o try to negotiate the price up more. I have a feeling she's told them we'll=
 sell it low, if she can convince me.

Darryl
