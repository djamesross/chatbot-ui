Hi Any,

I hope the driving test went well!=20

Here is the latest I received from Cynthia. To me it seems controlling, =
at a minimum, and the confrontational at best. She=E2=80=99s acting like =
she is the sole parent, who gets to assess me and decide our custody =
arrangements.

I mean seriously, is she going to ask to smell my breath? Make me walk a =
straight line? Either way, it=E2=80=99s invasive and doesn=E2=80=99t =
seem like it does anything to help the girls. It will only add stress. =
She is very aggressive when she does talk to me - unless anyone is =
around.=20

She sent an email yesterday asking to talk to me today. I said no, but I =
would consider talking to her Thursday, after I have the girls, and =
after I spoke to you.

Here is her email:

be dropping off Alice to you at the school. But before I release her, I =
