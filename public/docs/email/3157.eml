Yes my mom can drop them off at your mother=E2=80=99s house tomorrow =
instead of your house.

I hope that you reconsider agreeing to a longer visit tomorrow. In terms =
of plans, none of the plans listed in your emails below were important =
in the end since they were cancelled, changed, or never actually =
registered for. They could be dropped off earlier since there is no =
longer a run tomorrow morning, or they could be picked up after the =
soccer game since they are no longer going to it with you.=20

Anyhow, I hope you will reconsider.

Darryl
