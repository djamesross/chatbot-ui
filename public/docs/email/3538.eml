Gymnastic ended.  You never asked or discussed if we could afford it. You ne=
ver told me you enrolled them. Please update me as to what you have them in,=
 as well as medical and dental information. They should not be how I find su=
ch things, nor should Sunlife.  Alice does not want to do soccer, but wants t=
o spend the time their with me.

Yesterday was totally inappropriate. I have asked you text and we meet at th=
e door. I responded in 3 minutes and was not out of contact for the day. You=
r earlier text required no reply. I taught Char to bike and started with Ali=
ce. It has even discussed.=20

Please respect my boundaries. You know I am working on learning to be assert=
ive and shy away from aggression. So the girls are not confused please tell m=
e the =E2=80=98excuse=E2=80=99 given for yesterday. I will not malign you. I=
 desperately wanted to come up but realized they would only be confused seei=
ng me awake and healthy, as my doctors note support. They must be central an=
d come before us.=20

I have asked dr Fraser about periodic drug and alcohol screening. She said i=
t is unreliable, and time and consistency matter. Krystale closed the case, s=
tating no restrictions and that we need to work for their interests.

My mom is the most trustworthy person, and I am completely open with her. Ye=
t she is and is not up to your standards, and then you go around me. The int=
ent is clear. She will always protect her grandchildren, unlike the supervis=
ed visits imposed, or not checking in, as was dictated.

We have a temporarily motion that needs to be changed. I am saying I will no=
t give up on my daughters, and court is the absolute last option, but is a l=
ast resort. I am prepared to appeal given recent decisions. =20

At no point were you given sole custody and access and I acted in good faith=
 all summer, as records show. The police confirmed that when they were calle=
d. Also, if informed it was your sisters birthday I have shown I am cooperat=
ive and would have made the day work.

This Thursday I am flexible now that Algonquin is moving to a work from home=
 model. Is it important or significant? We were moving back to consistency, b=
ut the occasional exception is fine.=20

I will pursue this unless advised otherwise by a child psychologist. My prim=
ary argument will be, for Ms. Boyce, that your client has taken every opport=
unity to keep the girls from their father, while I am committed to maximal p=
arental contact, and will ensure it.=20

Now it is up to you to answer any remaining questions. I am not and will not=
 be your legal counsel.=20

We really can do this, as adults. They deserve and have the right to it.=20

I will catch up on section 7 expenses when income tax comes in. Please forwa=
rd any relevant documents to speed the process.=20

Finally, because of Sunday make up time needs to be planned. I am free tomor=
row. =20

And given the economy the girls deserve to learn about technology, programmi=
ng, and coding. Refusing them that cannot be justified. Refusing to allow th=
em to the college will be one ,ore part of this case if we cannot come to an=
 agreement. Charlotte gets it so well I wish you could see, and Alice is mor=
e intrigued as her sister learns more. Even lawyers jobs are at risk going f=
orward, as are some medical specialists. They have to be priority.=20

Finally, for Ms. Boyce, i was vulnerable at the time and it is far to late, b=
ut your insistence I needn=E2=80=99t attend court led to a slight but signif=
icant change in wording from documents we signed in your office vs those sub=
mitted in court.

Lesson learned, but I will follow up with the bar. I wanted to inform you be=
fore doing so to be transparent.=20
