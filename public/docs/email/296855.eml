Ok - I=E2=80=99ll call, or stop in on Tuesday, when I=E2=80=99m =
downtown. It won=E2=80=99t be much to start, but I will start and make =
sure it=E2=80=99s paid in full.

A number of questions have come up, now that things have changed. I know =
it=E2=80=99s the weekend, so I don=E2=80=99t expect reply today (or even =
for a few days):

the family Cynthia has agreed too will not support me (long story, but =
they think they are helping me as best they can by saying no. And then =
there is my sister=E2=80=A6 An even longer story.) This obviously looks =
bad, but what options do I have? You mentioned an agency that will come =
out and monitor visits, but it=E2=80=99s costly and hopefully a last =
option. What about my Aunt or Mom? At this point, would it hurt to try =
negotiating with Cynthia? She did call her dad a pedophile, but is =
seeing him again, so I feel like she might be open to it - and my mom =
was nothing like what she said about him. But I know she has custody =
now, and the rights that go with it. (By the way, I ran into her dad and =
we=E2=80=99re going to meet for coffee. He=E2=80=99s a fascinating =
person.)
Realistically, assuming I do everything I can, short of in-treatment =
(for the cost) how long do you think it will be until I can apply for =
joint custody again? If it=E2=80=99s a few months, I=E2=80=99ll stay =
where I am, but if its longer it makes sense to move closer to the city =
and save money on rent (save a lot of money, travel costs, and commute =
time). What=E2=80=99s your best guess?
In the meantime, is ok to talk to Cynthia, as much as she is willing? =
Can I be open and honest with her? Can I actually talk to her, as much =
as she is willing to talk? I guess what I=E2=80=99m asking is at this =
point can anything I say really hurt me, help me, or matter? I=E2=80=99m =
ready to make nice with her - as much as I can, and as genuinely as I =
can. And she seems to want to talk, and work on things. It=E2=80=99s =
extremely hard to trust her, but I want to try, have wanted try, and =
know it=E2=80=99s best for the girls, and all of our family. What do you =
think?
Finally, at some point, I=E2=80=99d like to talk about paying my bill. =
It's hard to know how quickly I can do it until I know where things =
stand with Cynthia, and where I=E2=80=99ll be living, but I want to make =
sure it=E2=80=99s paid as soon as I can. You=E2=80=99ve helped me so =
much, and given me so much trust, and I know how valuable your time is. =
There are few people I trust more than you, Any.
In the meantime, I hope you are having a good weekend, and enjoying the =
sun,

Darryl

Does it mean that she plans on keeping our schedule, where I get the =
girls for two days/nights, as long as someone is here? I assumed I would =
get a couple of hours. If she=E2=80=99s willing to let the girls stay =
here, as long as a family member is present, that would be amazing, but =
we=E2=80=99ll have open the language to find family members that can do =
this on a weekly basis - which I want to do, but not all family members =
can do. (And which would also be good because they could vouch for me =
not drinking)
