Ms. Boyce,

As I am sure you are aware the legal system is in a unique and
unprecedented position. The Ontario Superior Court Chief Justice has
ensured that an accessible and effective family justice system continue to
function, and has outlined a guide to process, with variation among
jurisdictions, which builds on the Family Law Strategic Plan and the Child
Prioritization Initiative, the goal being, as I have said all along, to
reduce conflict which has the most damaging effects on children.

Yet your client continues to create conflict where none need exist, and I
have made multiple requests for alternative forms of resolution. But put
simply when your client was told no restrictions means no restrictions and
the case was closed, she took it upon herself to impose restrictions that
are more stringent than those outlined in the court orders. She has
interfered with and used control of the girls to interfere with my
relationship with my daughters, and their right to have a relationship with
me independent of interference. Your client has, numerous times, ensured
that I treated as the least important part of my daughter=E2=80=99s lives. =
And she
has done so in a way that hurts the girls, is likely to cause confusion and
anxiety, and shows no concern for their emotions, wishes, or experience.
They have spent time with me, see me healthy and strong, and yet you tell
them I am sick. How do you propose to justify that disregard for our
daughters?

Ms. Boyce, it was your client that was said she was concerned with
consistency, yet numerous documents show demonstrates no concern for
consistency, and a refusal for a schedule during the summer. At times she
demands supervision, location, supervisor and time limits based not on the
girl=E2=80=99s best interests but those of her elderly parents. She refused=
 to
allow my mother to supervise and has shown no concern for the relationship
that she has developed with the girls. And then she asks her, without
consulting me, to take responsibility for driving. Be it notes one of her
allegations is that I will take and withhold the girls from her. Ms. Holmes
behavior reveals a pattern that is directed toward minimizing the girls
right to develop an independent relationship with me, to their confusion
and detriment.

I had more access when I was struggling with addiction to alcohol, and your
client=E2=80=99s concern was merely to be notified if I was unavailable (mi=
nutes of
meeting with CAS). She has consistently exerted a more invasive approach
than CAS, with no evidence. She demanded and forcefully walked into my
living space, including bedroom, after being asked not to. The onus is on
her to prove her allegations, which CAS has confirmed they will not be
investigating.

She has taken the girls away from me without explanation to me or the girls
on three unfounded occasions. When I was struggling with addiction it was
justified. In contrast, at the end of the summer she raised no safety
concerns but merely informed me of the access schedule, based on how busy
the girls were. Only later did I find out from the girls that four nights
of activities turned into one evening and an afternoon. The contradictions
continue and change, but consistently ensure that contact with me is
limited as much as possible, and now completely cut off. Her justifications
did not raise safety concerns and she did not take the necessary step of
notifying the appropriate authorities. She claims to have made the decision
with your support. She provided multiple and conflicting justifications but
seems to have settled most recently on medication. I have followed my
treatment plan, have full support of doctors and counsellors trained to
recognize such claims, and yet she dismisses them. Her actions suggest she
has expertise that supersedes my family doctor, sleep doctor/psychiatrist,
counselor, and Dr. Willows, head of addictions at the Royal Ottawa.

There is ample evidence of restricting the girls time with me, imposing her
own supervision and access schedule which is in breech of the court orders,
refuses to talk to me, mediate, work with a counsellor, or any other
alternative to the courts I have suggested. Furthermore, she is potentially
causing the girls anxiety by not being able to see me healthy and fit
during the pandemic, and confusing them by allowing her son Sam to move
between her home and his fathers, while restricting them from doing so. She
has also had visitors and I have no idea if she is following Covid-19
guidelines. I certainly see the girls wrestling and playing.

I would please ask you to address the following questions:

-          Can she provide evidence she is following provincial health
regulations?

-          Why is she restricting Facetime with the girls when they are
bored and cannot attend school? I am an educator, they enjoy talking to me,
yet she ends conversations for reasons including it=E2=80=99s time for a wa=
lk, it=E2=80=99s
simply time to end the conversation, or she will only allow the girls to
call immediately before snacks and a movie, which diverts their attention.

-          Why is she ignoring the fact that CAS sees no grounds for
concern, and the fact that they are not opening an investigation?

-          Please explain to me why, contrary to legal precedent, she
presumes her decisions supersede those of the court, CAS, and me.

-          Which of the reasons provided for refusing to follow our
settlement is she going to argue, will it change, and what evidence, aside
from hearsay, can she provide?

-          Why is Ben no longer living with either parent, and does it have
to do with the girls?

-          Can you please respond to my question if you represent Ms.
Holmes, or if there has been a change?

-          Finally, on what grounds has your client refused to exercise
joint custody?

These questions are asked after the Chief Justice has stated that even in
the face of a pandemic parties must comply with orders.

Since informing me she will, of her own accord, deny any contact with the
girls she finally did the right things and notified CAS. And I suspect they
are aware of the pattern at this point. The notice to Profession clearly
states that =E2=80=9CDuring this temporary suspension of regular operations=
, the
Court calls upon the cooperation of counsel and parties to engage in every
effort to resolve matters.=E2=80=9D Why is Ms. Holmes refusing cooperation,=
 which
she has demonstrated in the past?

Your client has actively worked against any resolution, as a matter of
record. Her actions interfere with my daughters right to have a
relationship with me.

Your client continues to illegally withhold Charlotte and Alice from access
from me based on her own assessment and hearsay from parties that have not
had any significant contact with me. And yet during much of the time she
did allow some unsupervised access. Her behavior works against her duty to
the principle of maximum contact, which is in the girl=E2=80=99s best inter=
est, and
suggests her concerns are not genuine, following what a parent is expected
to do,

Furthermore, your client has admitted to physically abusing her oldest son,
and I have witnessed her verbally abuse him.

This is an extremely unfortunate situation, but it has allowed me not only
time to research case law but to access legal aid and other resources. Your
client is putting herself in a position that courts have consistently ruled
against, and in some cases reversing access Have you informed her of all of
the possible outcomes that could arise, and what I may be requesting when
the courts return to normal?

For know, unless your client agrees to the settlement signed in your
office, I have done all I can to avoid court, while you and Ms. Holmes have
done all you can to ignore me. Setting up a situation such as she has is
not grounds for a claim for status quo. It is contrived, and case law
supports that.

It is worth reading the conclusion from the Chief Justice: =E2=80=9CThis su=
spension
will cause substantial inconvenience to those with matters before the
Court. The decision to engage this emergency process was not made lightly.
However, the health and safety of the public, as well as all justice
participants is a priority.

We ask for and appreciate your co-operation, flexibility and understanding
during this extraordinary time.=E2=80=9D

These are two girls with incredible potential that deserve to have their
interests made central. And so says the law.

I have seen no evidence of any attempt to cooperate. Yet I have tried to
engage both of you constructively, I have suggested solutions rather than
threats, bringing this to court leaves life long decisions up to a judge
who is already overburdened; it is in the interest of the girls for us to
try to negotiate, and unburden the court.

Let us ask ourselves how we should be conducting ourselves, and reflect on
how, most important your client is affecting the girls.

Your client allows some communication, but also blocks it and is usually
present, in Face Time, or talking for or over the girls. She has shown no
concern for the girls=E2=80=99 relationship with my mother, yet claims dist=
ant
relatives take precedence over me.

I make no claims to know her thoughts or intentions, but she has provided
ample evidence in her conduct, decisions, and assumption of sovereignty
over all decisions.

So, an urgent motion for access which can be arranged and follow provincial
health guidelines. And because your client knew and waited until I gave
notice and committed to this, more expensive place as per our agreement to
cease child support so we can return to shared custody, I am in financial
hardship and do not have a place to live as of the 1st of May. The courts
have been hearing dire issues regarding financial circumstances and have
begun to expand what they will hear as of 6 April 2020.

Finally, I find it sad and unfortunate that she has taken these steps. I
sincerely hope she maintains a close and healthy relationship with our
daughters through their lives, but while I will not share the details of
her allegations and actions, families talk, and the girls may come to
resent her, which would be unfortunate. I have always maintained that I
will support their relationship with their mother, without interfering or
trying to affect it. It is their right to have a relationship with each of
us without interference.

This is an evolving situation, but I would direct your attention to Ribeiro
V. Wright as an example: even the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic does not
equal cancellation of parenting time. Yet your client has not raised
Covid-19, instead relying on aggression, entering my place of residence
after explicitly being asked not to, and making false claims that I was out
of communications. Those communications are the basis of her confrontation
and aggression. They will be evidence, as opposed to allegations.

I will be filling, but as I have said before if your client cooperates, and
she has proven she can and will, we can avoid court and focus our concern
on the well-being of the girls. They deserve it, I is law, and the only
basis a judge can rule on.

I hope, but do not expect to hear from you. But your client can do better
and is obliged to do so for the girls.

 Darryl
