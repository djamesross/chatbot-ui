Hi Kate,

I don=E2=80=99t know if this wasn=E2=80=99t mentioned because it=E2=80=99s=
 coming, was overlooked, or is being withheld conditionally, but I want =
to ask again for information about the girls, both in general, but more =
worrying is the distress Ms. Holmes describes. Will that information be =
shared with me? I=E2=80=99d really like to know more about who they have =
been taken to for support, and what support or counselling is in place =
for them. Will that information be provided?=20

Thanks again,

Darryl

child pyschologist that we briefly brought Charlotte to in 2016 and who =
I continued to work with afterward for additional support, and Dr. Carol =
