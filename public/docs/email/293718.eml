Hi Alison,

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. I have an important
appointment this week, and and I am waiting to hear back from my EAP for
advice.

I do hope that we can work this out for the best outcome for all, and will
be in touch as soon as I can gather the material requested, and receive
advice on how best to proceed for all.

Best,

Darryl

Hi Alison,

will also ensure to pay the amount owing within the time frame.

Best,

Darryl

Dear Mr. Ross,

Attached, please find a copy of the Endorsement from the Case Conference
held on January 19, 2018. Kindly note that there will be an Order to go
issued by the Court, which I will send you upon receipt.

I would ask that you note that there have been costs awarded against you in
the amount of $450, payable within 30 of the date of the Endorsement. You
are required to pay these costs to Ms. Holmes, preferably through my
office, within the next thirty days.

I would also remind you that you are still required to provide
the disclosure ordered pursuant to the Order of Master Fortier
dated October 4, 2017. Additionally, further disclosure with respect to
your 2017 income is required from you and has been ordered.

Further, I intend to bring a motion for child support and repayment
of section 7 extraordinary expenses. Kindly let me know your
availability for the following dates in March and April 2018:

March 13th, 15th, 20th, 22nd, 27th, 29th

April 10th, 19th, 24th, 26th

If I do not hear from you by *noon on Friday, January 26th* then I will
go ahead and book a date without further consulting you for
your availability.

I would encourage you to contact me to negotiate settlement of
the above-noted issues, in writing. Should you fail to do so, and
Ms. Holmes is required to proceed to the motion, I will be seeking
further costs against you.

You may contact me in writing should you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
Alison
