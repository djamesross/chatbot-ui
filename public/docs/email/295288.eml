Hi Cynthia,

I will agree to change from the current 2-6 pm, to 11 am - 5 pm on =
Sunday. Please confirm.

I don=E2=80=99t know if you intentionally used not seeing an aunt who =
lives in another province and has a child as a priority over my =
relationship with the girls in light of Justice Smoji=E2=80=99s ruling =
about unlawfully withholding our daughters from me for more than two =
years, or the damage that it caused. I will assume that it was not. This =
is a holiday and a long weekend, and it has been more than 3 years since =
they have been allowed to see their dad on or around Thanksgiving, let =
alone all other holidays, special events, birthdays, and on and on. I =
think that priorities have to be discussed and agreed on. Related is the =
matter of court ordered parental reunification therapy, as it pertains =
to parenting time and moving forward. I did not receive any potential =
counsellors from you by the judges deadline or to date. Can you please =
send me contact information for counsellor=E2=80=99s that you have =
found. Did you contact Marianne Cuhaci? If yes please update. If you =
have not found counsellors please explain why and what you are doing =
about it, or when I can expect to receive names.

Thank you,

Darryl
