Hi Linda,

There is a really neat park south of me that I don=E2=80=99t think the =
girls have been to before, with splash pad - I just came across it =
biking. I can find the address and send it to you, or you can let me =
know where you=E2=80=99d like to meet, and what time works.

Let me know what works best for you,

Darryl=
