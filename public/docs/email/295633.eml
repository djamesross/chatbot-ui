I'm confident they are available for at least a brief make up visit for
your rash reaction and preventing me from our agreed upon time yesterday.
The onus will be on you to justify that.

Once again, you are directing anger you hold against me and making
decisions based on your view of me without regard for the girls.

For the record this is confirmation that your have decided to prevent the
plans we made, which the girls were so excited for. Those are plans we have
had since the trailer came out. You owe them an honest explanation, just as
you claimed they required about my period of drinking, and we will have to
be on the same page. I also expext a refund for the cost of the tickets
because you refused to allow us to see a movie, for which you have no
justification. I'm sorry to say it but this is pretty and punitive.

You can't justify why you accept visitation in a place that is more
open and more likely to trigger your fears, rather than a movie theatre,
which is a constrained space.

This is truly sad for the girls, who you are showing complete disregard
foe, confusing, and create distress. It is not too late to act reasonably,
and deescalte the conflict you have created and seem to seek out. As part
of the motion I am bringing I will be asking that we return to Sharon.

All I want is time to spend with my daughters, and this is fully suported
by family law. A heroine addict has the right more access and respect than
you are giving me.

I'm sorry you were lied to by members of my family, but I did try to warn
you. You told me, in writing, you wanted nothing to do with my famy, which
turned out to be untrue. I'm sorry to be so blunt but you were used as an
attempt to further their own interests. This is documented, as you read in
my motion.

The motion will not be about you or I, but the best interests of the girls.
Confirm that with your lawyer.
