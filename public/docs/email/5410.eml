Laura has been an incredible resource for Alice, and I think it=E2=80=99s =
important for her to maintain that relationship, and to continue with =
her in the fall. After you and I agreed on summer arrangements, I let =
Laura know that Alice and Charlotte will be taken care of for the =
summer. She was fine with that (after all, we did let her know that I =
have summers off, and that the girls will be at home for summers).

In addition, Sharon=E2=80=99s recommendations were very clear: the girls =
should be with a parent as much as possible, and the girls should have =
as few caregivers as we can manage.

I=E2=80=99m on summer leave as of this week, so for Monday morning you =
can drop them off with me.=20

The girls will spend time with Sully and Mackenzie and other friends at =
the parks and at Baxter beach, among other activities.=20
