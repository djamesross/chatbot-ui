Hi Lynda,

I=E2=80=99m meeting Cynthia and the girls at the park tomorrow. We=E2=80=99=
ve both discussed trying to communicate more, and more positively. =
She=E2=80=99s also indicated that she=E2=80=99d like me to start seeing =
the boys again, which is wonderful news.

I dropped my phone in the river, so I don=E2=80=99t currently have one. =
I=E2=80=99m hoping it can be repaired, but won=E2=80=99t know for a day =
or two. I can Skype, and always email. If it can=E2=80=99t be repaired, =
I=E2=80=99ll have to get a new one (I get mine through the college, so =
it can take a few days). Next week later Wednesday or after would work =
best - for whoever is going to take over for Heather.

I=E2=80=99ll try you Monday (somehow), and set up a time.

Best,

Darryl
