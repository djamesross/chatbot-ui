I will make sure. I understand you=E2=80=99re in court the next two =
days. Would you be able to meet for an hour Friday or Monday? I have a =
number of questions, but they can wait.

If you have do have a chance, I have a few short questions, mostly just =
yes or no:
Should I accept without prejudice and strictly interim, the visitation =
they proposed?
Is there an advantage to bringing the motion, or have the motion brought =
by her?
And should I devote time to addressing each allegation, especially the =
patiently false ones, or simply move forward with the affidavit and =
ensure I have complied with all of the orders?

Thanks. And good luck in court!

Darryl
