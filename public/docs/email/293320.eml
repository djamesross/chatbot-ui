Dear Cynthia,

Thank you for confirming Friday, August 18 and next Tuesday, August 22.

It was already agreed that Tuesdays would be extended for the summer, =
and this includes next Tuesday, August 22, as well as this past Tuesday, =
August 8. It was also previously agreed that missed parenting time would =
be made up and this included the time they were scheduled to be away and =
unavailable this summer. The time missed while they were away in =
Saskatoon was made up without issue, leaving one final visit to schedule =
before summer vacation ends the week after next. I am suggesting =
Thursday, August 24, but the 23 or 24th may work as well if they are =
more convenient.

I am not agreeable to moving to once-weekly visits and reducing the =
amount of parenting time Tuesday evenings once school begins. I don=E2=80=99=
t think it=E2=80=99s in the best interests of the girls and does not =
follow the order. Please let me know if there are any other evenings =
that might work and I will try to accommodate to make Tuesdays work for =
earlier practice. I think it=E2=80=99s important to be flexible and try =
to find ways to solve issues as they come up, because they will =
continually come up.

Regards,

Darryl
