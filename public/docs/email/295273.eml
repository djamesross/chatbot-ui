Ms Boyce, I have been informed by your client that she is once again solely
and without cause changing and further restricting access to my daughters
based on what she claims is a feeling of distress felt on the part of her
mother.

Be it known that my mother was present for the conversation, and that this
is entirely about a claim made about her mother's 'feeling' of distress,
who had no reason or right to be present or supervising. .

Furthermore, your client is restricting my access and reneging once again
on an access agreement, because of her mother's subjective feeling, at a
time when she has been told supervision is neither necessary nor
recommended by CAS. This now demonstrates a pattern in which she willingly
seeks out opportunities to withhold and act in bad faith based on her
subjective feelings or those of her mother's, without regard to the girls
best interests and commitments they are counting on. This is a clear
attempt to limit the girls right to maximum contact with their father, and
interferes with my right to parent my children.

Forgive me if I am not up to date on case law, but I am catching up. But I
believe it was Justice Price's ruling in *Foliahan v. Folahan* (2013) who
ruled that the Divorce Act is based on the assumption that the principle of
maximum contact applies. Following that ruling, it is incumbent upon your
client to prove that supervised access is in the children's best interest.
Your client cannot do so. Supervised access is, after all, a last resort
reserved for exceptional circumstances. As I will be arguing, the onus is
on the fearful parent to establish the necessity of supervised access, and
to do so from the best interests of the children, not the convenience,
ability, or feelings of the supervisor. A supervision who, it needs to be
noted, was never agreed upon, and told unnecessary by CAS.

In sum, your client is breaking an agreement without regard to the
children's best interests, based instead on the response of a supervisor
who was imposed and assessed as unnecessary.

Given the dramatic shifts your client makes I will remain at the college
and expect them to be dropped off her at the agreed time. What was put i
place and what I actively cooperated with as a time limited provision has
been abused by your client. The time for supervision has long passed, and
in fact was passed this summer, at least while she had no other options for
child care, and will not hold in court. Furthermore, denying the girls
rights to spend Sunday with me watching a movie we have been planning for
months, that they are counting on and excited for, is purely punitive and
shows disregard for my daughters feelings.

I see no recourse provided by your client but to escalate this, at her
sole discretion. I will be at the college following our agreement.  What
she decides to do, with your advisement, is beyond my control. I certainly
can't show up at the place she's dictated only to find out she's once again
acted in bad faith and denied me access for a new reason.

Darryl
