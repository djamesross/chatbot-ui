Hi Darryl,

I am worried that you will not return the girls at 530 pm and need some reas=
surance. I have not met with the family you are living with, nor have I had a=
 conversation with them. Last time it caused Alice great distress when you k=
ept them in August against my consent.

I discussed the scenario with my lawyer and I am only comfortable with the g=
irls spending time at your place at this time with a supervisor present unti=
l I can meet with the family you live with and have a conversation with them=
.

Again this is only temporary until trust can be rebuilt and I can be reassur=
ed that you are seeking treatment as I am still awaiting your documentation.=


If you do not agree to a supervisor at your place until I can meet with the f=
amily when they return from vacation on January 3rd then we will continue to=
 meet at other locations.

The girls are available to meet with you at Indigo in Barrhaven at 330 pm un=
less you change your mind and agree to my terms.=20

Please confirm.

Cynthia
