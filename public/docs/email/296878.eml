Cynthia came by and we talked. A little heated, but felt like some progress.=
 Says she's wants 50-50, that it's hard having all the kids all the time, an=
d it's best for them. But I don't know if I trust her.=20

She all my documents and disclosure, and then, if they're good, we can go ba=
ck to the way things are.=20

Could this be a play?=20

Anyhow, I'm trying to meet with dr. Milstone, and will you know.=20
