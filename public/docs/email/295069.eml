Without Prejudice,

I will accept this visit on a without prejudice basis because you are =
refusing any other contact with my children. I do not agree with =
supervision to my parenting time, it is does not benefit my children, =
and since May 31 CAS confirmed there are no protection concerns and =
closed the file.

However, your house is not an appropriate place for a visit. I would =
suggest Ken Ross Park, or Chapters if the weather is not agreeable.
