This is far more than difficult for me, Cynthia, this is unacceptable. =
But this is not about me, it=E2=80=99s about the girls. You have offered =
and also agreed to a steady increase in the time they spend with me. I =
spoke to them yesterday to ask how they=E2=80=99re feeling and what they =
want, assuming you had at least raised this wit them. You did not talk =
to them, or shown any concern for how they feel. You know and have known =
I=E2=80=99m moving and to a place where the girls can stay with me half =
time, and at the last minute, you make a sudden and dramatic decision =
that affects our daughters and me. You are actively interfering with, =
and informing me that you now have the right and are going to restrict =
my access to the girls, something CAS explained to you clearly is no =
longer necessary or appropriate.=20

So, how can you possibly justify this? What reasons are you basing this =
decision on?

To date, the only concern you have mentioned is a feeling of discomfort, =
which is not sufficient. That would make this only about your feelings, =
which is what it appears to be.

If not, I deserve, at the very least, to hear your justification as =
their father and parent, and expect to receive them presently, given you =
claim to have made this decision after consideration and consultation =
with your lawyer.
