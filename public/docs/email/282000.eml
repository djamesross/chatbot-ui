Thanks for getting back to me. However, some of these questions you can
answer without speaking with HR. Please response to my questions below:


-What does "short team leave" mean? ( ie Are you currently receiving
paycheck from work?)
-When did you begin "short term" leave?
-Did you submit all the required paperwork to FRO? If so, when? If not,
when can we expect you to do this?
-When can I expect some sort of child support payment from you?
