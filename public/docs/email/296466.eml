Any,

I=92m trying to get a sense of where we=92re at now. If Charlotte is =
back in school, we can=92t make an urgent motion. But if Cynthia =
continues to make allegations and refuses me access, what can I do? Are =
there any other legal steps I can take? It just seems so wrong that she =
can do this.

Darryl
