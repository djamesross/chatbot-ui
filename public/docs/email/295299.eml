Thank you for letting me know. They included Rebecca in emails when Cynthia
included Alison, so I am forwarding the email I just sent in case that is
to continue.

I forgot to include Alison in the conversation, as your representative. Mea
culpa. Had I representation, I'd be curious to find out if 'stole' is an
appropriate or accurate accusation.

Actually, on second thought, I'd save the money, omit the word, and use
reasonable communication.

Hi Cynthia,

Is this the reason you are withholding contact with the girls from me? I've
addressed the issue and it needn't be repeated.

You have been vague or merely silent, not answering questions. I have asked
but still do not know if they are starting school tomorrow. I assume that
they are and I would have liked to speak to them tonight before an
important day, intending to support any excitement and offering support to
any anxiety they may feel. I called several times, left a message, but
received no response.

To communicate to benefit the girls I would like to try mediation. There
are many types, and they are effective when the parents are invested
in participating for the children. In some we work together on
communication, and others where we work separately, but all for the benefit
of the girls. I see no reason to refuse and continue to ignore me unless it
comes to money.

You gave me a deadline of September 4th. You are free to let Allison begin
a motion. However, I have clarified that the mistake was out of my control
and I am doing all that I can to maintain payments and return the dental
charge that could have been avoided with communication. You have yet to
confirm that you have received the payment from the FRO, and I kindly ask
that you do.

That is all I have to say on these topics.

I have two final and separate topics to address. Frist, I specifically
asked you last week if the time of Ali's soccer game changed to an
earlier time. You said no and I believe you. However, last night you said
that you found out several days ago they changed it, yet chose not to
inform me. That was very disappointing for me, their grandmother, and to
the girls.

Finally, you confirmed the plans made for Charlotte's birthday, which
include their grandmother. We have had two tragedies in the family, but
Wednesday or Thursday will work. I will try to use Zoom or another platform
so we can connect and make sure no technical problems prevent us from
carrying through. I would suggest not using the projector, because this is
my time with Charlotte, and it provides another potential technical
problem. I appreciate the suggestion and found it thoughtful.

Darryl
