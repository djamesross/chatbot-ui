  Hi Cynthia,

Thank you for inviting me into the front entrance of your house and
allowing the girls to see me. As her father, I worried that a hornet stung
her, so I was glad to see her excited as she jumped up into my arms for a
hug and then showed me her sting.

However, I have to clarify the claims about ringing the doorbell., which I
did not ring. Not only did you invite me in the front entrance, you didn't
object when the girls asked me if I would drop off an extension cord for
the light I made for them later that evening. When I came to the door, I
could see Sam in the kitchen and knocked so quietly he didn't hear, so I
had to knock just a little harder for him to hear. But it was a quiet
knock, because I didn't want to wake the girls. Sam was very nice, and I
told him this was not a new normal. I have respected your space, never
entered unless invited, and only stopped by to drop off something they were
expecting and to see my daughter who appeared very upset when I spoke to
her on DUO.

We both love the girls and want what's best for them, and that includes
having two parents involved in their lives. However, following the claims
you have made about me, I have not been coming to the house except to leave
care packages for them, or on the day to drop off two toys they had both
been asking for. Ali loves her Glampler, and Char has a natural intuition
for electronics and programming, which is the future and will serve her
well in the careers that will dominate when she is an adult. She figured
out Cozmo and was enamored with it immediately.

Here's a link to the original:
https://kano.me/ca/store/products/computer-kit, based on a $35 Raspberry
Pi. I don't have a touch screen and the parts look different, but otherwise
it is essentially  the same hardware and software. I have the parts to
build the original, so she doesn't have to assemble it. Here's what Wired
has to say about it (albeit the newer, more expensive version):
https://www.wired.com/story/kano-pc-microsoft-partnership/

It will benefit her greatly, and hopefully draw Ali into a more active
engagement with technology, as opposed to a passive role.

Best,
Darryl
