I'm back at work. However, the girls are being cared for by my family. What
about on your days, will Laura be caring for them? As you know, Laura is
expecting a baby at the end of May and her daycare will be open until Mid
May. We should discuss looking for child care arrangements for Alice for
the Spring.

I spoke to Charlotte about this, she felt uncomfortable speaking about it
but said she only had a bad dream when Ben came into bed. We agreed that
she doesn't need to share her bed. I can't commit that the boys won't come
into the room on occasion as they like to be close with me, in fact many
times Charlotte will crawl into Sam bed with us when I'm in there and
cuddle with Sam.

I spoke to Heather CAS  about this last year about what is "appropriate"
when it comes to sleeping arrangments she said there is no rule and that
it's perfectly fine for the children to want to cuddle with their parents
and siblings. All the kids still ask for me to lie with them at nighttime
which I do and there is some bedsharing going on.

Of course, all this being said I will make sure the kids' personal space is
respected and keep the dialogue going so that no one is made to feel
uncomfortable.
