to alienate me or actually are trying to alienate them from me. That much i=

 child development. The courts recognize that. And that you are the sole pa=

 of CAS.

The entire summer is evidence in support of my case.

I don't understand why you need to keep this going as a fight. This isn't a=
bout us, and at any time I am ready to talk and I've made suggestions to do=
 so. I'm only pursuing court because you are giving me no other option, but=
 conflict is what hurts kids, not divorce or separation, and you have been =
driving the charge. I ask that we explore other options not for you, and no=
t for me, but for the girls. You've given no reason why they should not sta=
rt exactly where we left off in the summer, or rather you've given many con=
tradictory ones and different offers that show this is not about them, and =
that you don't have a central concern. Nor support in the form of hearsay f=
rom family members that have not seen me in over a year and have had no con=
tact with me other than email and their own interests. And you have not inq=
uired into how I am doing at all, showing that's not your concern  Again a =
judge will and can only legally consider the girl's best interests.

Leaving it to the judge takes it out of our ability to decide, which if it =
goes to course I may seek in anyhow in the form of parallel parenting.

Some things have to be met, but withholding the girls tomorrow will make it=
 worse when we can make it better. Last time cost a huge amount of money, b=
ut I am not seeking remuneration unless necessary. The priority is for our =
daughters to reap the benefits that come with two parents. And though exten=
sively documented, I have no interested in bringing up the pattern of behav=
ior or abuse of Ben. Neither would do any of us good.

Let the girls come here tomorrow, briefly say hi and be polite, and leave t=
hem for at least as long as you did when CAS was involved and there was a r=
eason to limit visitation, because this time there is none, and that will b=
e difficult to explain. Unfortunately, my aunt was dishonest about what I s=
aid, as has you've made sure to prove over the previous months. Doing so wo=
uld show that this is not an attempt tp punish me, and, I hope, the stat of=
 a basic trust we can build on.

But please be aware that this is private property and you don't have the ri=
ght to inspect or interrogate the family, including two very nice children,=
 or my life or interfere with my progress.

Please consider it for the girls, who want this, are confused, and expressi=
ng more and more to me their feelings.

There is a better way. A way that shows how much we both love them.
