Hi Dr. Milstone,

I wanted to send you a brief update, because I haven=E2=80=99t been able =
to come in recently. And i won=E2=80=99t be able to, for a while, =
because I am broke. (But for now, I am also overwhelmingly happy - see =
attachments!!!!)

It=E2=80=99s actually hard to summarize what=E2=80=99s happened since we =
last met without sounding crude. But here I go: I found out from =
Cynthia=E2=80=99s affidavit that she accused me of sexually assaulting =
Charlotte, our oldest daughter. 9 days after she left the house, and 3 =
days after she was served by a motion from my lawyer, she submitted =
Charlotte to an examination at CHEO, claiming that she believed I =
sexually assaulted Charlotte.

It was 14 days before I finally got to see the girls again, which was =
the longest and hardest time of my life. At times, not infrequently, I =
truly felt like my heart hurt. In fact, I=E2=80=99m convinced that it =
did. And I felt pain worse than any physical trauma I have yet received. =
All I can I say is holy fuck that hurt. And jesus-fucking-christ I would =
rather suffer a compound fracture. Only a few people truly understand =
that I was both mother and father to my daughters, but luckily my lawyer =
is one of them.

And I worked with my lawyer (as my bill reveals, hence my tight purse of =
late). I followed up every lead that I could (I joked about billing them =
but am considering a career change). I went to the police station, to =
CHEO, and spoke to CAS. I worked up a detailed timeline, I plotted her =
claims, versus my evidence, and cross-referenced the audio recordings. =
As for the authorities, Cynthia called them all. The police never =
followed up, CHEO found no signs of sexual abuse (of course, but I did =
go and pulled her record. And I found the attending nurse, who helped me =
decipher the medical record, and sopped up my tears). Luckily, the =
investigator from CAS did her due diligence - she met with both the =
police and CHEO and concluded that there was no reason to pursue the =
allegations.

Now, up to that point Cynthia was sticking to her guns: she was =E2=80=9Co=
nly following=E2=80=9D the investigation, and asked only that we wait =
for the investigation to run it=E2=80=99s course. Only when I met with =
the CAS did they reveal that they never had cause for concerns, beyond =
her accusations. (And there were so many more lies too=E2=80=A6) So with =
that out of the way, she happily=E2=80=A6 made up new excuses. Yes, she =
did.

But long story short, I=E2=80=99ve got the girls for now, and she=E2=80=99=
s crumbling. But not without demanding the house, the van, child =
support, and everything else in the world. And you=E2=80=99ll appreciate =
this -  she wants a week-on, week-off schedule, because she=E2=80=99s =
now sharing custody with Scott, the boys=E2=80=99 father. (And you=E2=80=99=
ll appreciate this even more: in her affidavit she says that they=E2=80=99=
ve always gotten along well, and that he=E2=80=99s been a huge help! And =
yes, I have reams of emails attesting otherwise).

My sister has suggested a title for the book of our lives - 'the last of =
the crazy ones.=E2=80=99 I for one would prefer that Jonathan Franzen =
wrote it, but we=E2=80=99ll work on those issues after the most pressing =
issues are settled.

I will try to make an appointment in the new year, or, the courts =
permitting, when I=E2=80=99m better off financially.
