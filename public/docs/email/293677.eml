Ms. Boyce,

I have informed Cynthia that she is welcome to visit when the girls first
come here, but she is expected to be polite and respectful and has no right
to interrogate the family, inspect their living quarters or even mine,
beyond a cursory look. To do so would be to imply greater authority than
CAS. Not is it appropriate to denigrate me. If she does any of these things
she will be told to leave. I believe it is good for the girls to see her
here with some comfort, but will not accept a scene and expect to be able
to progress with my life undisturbed by her. There are two children here,
12 and 13, who in particular will not be subject to any criticism or
outbursts. She is free to email me anything she likes afterward but will
find it a warm, welcoming home.

Darryl
