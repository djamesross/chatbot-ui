Hi Darryl,

Alison will be responding to most of your concerns shortly. In terms of
visiting with Charlotte and Alice, my mom is available for a park visit
tmrw after school. For Charlotte's bday if you would like to celebrate at a
restaurant I can check with Dennis on his availability to supervise either
Friday or Saturday night.

Cynthia
