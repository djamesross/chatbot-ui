Hi Cynthia,

My family has asked you to cease communication with them. My sister has =
no interest in communicating with you. She trusts me and has serious =
concerns about your behaviour. My family is in constant contact, and in =
their own words they feel  harassed by you. I am their father, and I am =
the only person that you should be communicating with.=20

For special events I will keep you informed, as I always do. It=E2=80=99s =
clear why you try to go around me, and exclude me. But my family will =
not take part, even with threats. It was completely inappropriate to =
email my aunts, who were very upset by your email, and at no time =
doubted me as a parent. And it should be noted that you sent that =
threatening email well after you told your lawyer one of my family =
members had terrible things to say about me. The fact is they did not, =
and then you threatened them. If you continue, they may have a case for =
harassment (you can pay your lawyer to find out wether that=E2=80=99s =
the case or not).=20

I'm their father and there is no legitimate reason to try to go around =
me. You continue to disregard our parenting agreement, which was agreed =
upon in good faith, signed by both of us, with witnesses, and which you =
have refused to follow.

I will be addressing your latest concerns in the near future, with the =
documents your lawyer requested. And I=E2=80=99m confident. In the =
meantime I can unequivocally state that the girls are always safe in my =
care.

The fact of the matter is the the girls need both of us, and I=E2=80=99m =
sorry that you can=E2=80=99t see or accept that, and that it will take a =
custody and access assessment to make that clear.

Darryl
