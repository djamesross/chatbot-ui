I understand that you have been depressed, stressed, and struggling in our =
relationship recently. However, the girls should never have been taken from=
 our home, or from me. There is no basis for your actions. I have a right t=
o see them, and I would like to
 pick them up from school =C2=A0tomorrow and keep them for the night. While=
 they are at school tomorrow we can discuss a temporary schedule for visita=
tion.<br>
<br>
You can let me know what you need for the night and for tomorrow and I will=
 pack it for you and leave it inside or outside of the house. I will also p=
ack a bag for the girls, and include anything the boys need. However, it is=
 not acceptable to remove any additional
 belongings.<br>
<br>
My lawyer has made it clear to me that you are not acting legally, and she =
will be in contact tomorrow. If =C2=A0you don&#39;t return the girls we wil=
