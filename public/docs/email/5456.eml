A couple of things:

I assume you=E2=80=99re back at work this week, and so the girls will be =
with Laura a couple of days. I have to work this evening, so let me know =
about pick-up time.

Last week when we were putting Char=E2=80=99s new bed together she =
mentioned that Ben has crawled into bed with her on occasion, and that =
it made her uncomfortable. She didn=E2=80=99t suggest or imply anything =
inappropriate, other than not wanting him to, and finding it =
uncomfortable. I=E2=80=99m not making any accusations, but feel that =
it's important to ensure that the boys do not go into the girls=E2=80=99 =
beds at night to respect Char=E2=80=99s feelings, and because of the age =
differences.  Will you make sure that doesn=E2=80=99t happen anymore?
