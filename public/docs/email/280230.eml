Hi Darryl

I can confirm I will bring Charlotte and Alice earlier today at 2:30 pm.

As for making up the remainder of time I will be speaking to my lawyer
today and will get back to you.

Charlotte is still ill,  she missed soccer game last night and camp this
morning.


She can be dropped off at practice tonight and will just watch her team as
a spectator . Please have your mom drop Alice off here.


Cynthia
