Just to be clear I am not accusing you of having any part in this aside
from not providing me with enough information. The question I asked was not
answered and is very clear: did you send me that email as a warning or did
that email come from them? This is important to know because it will allow
me to know whether they have my email address or you sent that email
address to use that that email to me as a courtesy and warning and so they
don=E2=80=99t have access to my email.

So just to clear did that email come from you, as in you wrote it to me
once your account was secured, or was it set when your account was
compromised and a bunch of were set out to people on your list and I was
one of them. Yes no question.
