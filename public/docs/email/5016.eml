Hey,

Sorry for not replying sooner. There is a lot going on, including a =
potential strike starting Monday (which will mean I get less than half =
my regular pay). Tomorrow afternoon will work. I had to pack all the =
clothes up in bins because my landlords were showing the house last =
night, but I=E2=80=99ll pull out all the the costumes and girls=E2=80=99 =
fall/winter clothes, and we can go through them.=20

Would you be able to bring the girls? And, if they=E2=80=99re =
comfortable, it would be so nice to see the boys=E2=80=99 too.

Let me know,

Darryl
