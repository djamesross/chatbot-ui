We have booked a sleigh ride for Dec 26th at 1:00 pm outside of Wakefield.
It only holds 15 people so we were thinking kids and one or two adults.
Then, Claire is having dinner at her place.  Most of us are staying over
(your dad and I in a hotel and Ale and Alex also because Alex is deadly
allergic to cats) and going skiing the next day.  You guys are welcome to
come to the sleigh ride and dinner. And if you want to go skiing the next
day too at Vorlage.  Unfortunately, will all of the kids, Claire only has so
much room for people to sleep.  But you guys could come back and forth!  Can
you please let me know within a week or so if you think you will make it
because Claire has to order the food way ahead of time because the places
she uses can only take so many orders. Christmas is so much fun!
