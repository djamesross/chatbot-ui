Hi Denyse and Any,

We might need to follow up on this later in January -=20

I received the following message from Cynthia today (see below). I =
replied, quoting her own lawyers letter, dated 8 Dec. 2015, which stated =
that we would have the house listed =E2=80=98early in January=E2=80=99, =
and reminded her that I would continue to pay half of the mortgage and =
insurance, but no more.=20

My position is that her dates are arbitrary and without legal basis. She =
rented a place that she cannot afford under her current circumstances, =
and I cannot be expected to subsidize her living conditions. It is not =
realistic to think that the house will be sold and possession taken, for =
a reasonable price, in the next 40 days. Realistically, we will sell in =
about two months (the average time to sale for a house), and possession =
will be 1-3 months after that, if we=E2=80=99re lucky. Until that time, =
I maintain that we are both equally responsible for the mortgage.

Cynthia=E2=80=99s message:

Sorry I did speak with my lawyers about this and they agree. We agreed =
to sell the house in early December and you still haven't listed it. In =
early December, I agreed on Dimitri and the listing price of $530K. You =
didn't move on this. Then you and I verbally agreed to sell privately, I =
wanted this as well but then over Christmas, you changed your mind =
stating you can't work with me. Yesterday after my insistence you picked =
other two agents to speak with and meet this Friday, I agreed and made =
arrangements to take time of work to meet them with you on Friday. Now =
you are uncomfortable meeting with them with me and may go back to =
selling privately and demanding I pay to do this. I'm sorry Darryl but I =
just can't keep going back and forth. If its not listed by Jan. 14th on =
a agreed price I'm not going to be able to keep paying the mortgage. I =
know you are angry and hurt right now but its in both of our best =
interest that the house be sold right away, we all agreed on this with =
our lawyers when we met in early December.=20


If we can get this house listed by Jan 14th, I can only pay until Feb. =
19th. I know you are upset about this but its all I can afford, we =
currently make close to the same salaries and I have two other children =
to support. Also I work 37.5 hours a week and I'm unable to meet =
frequently during the days.=20

Sorry you are hurt and mad but what is done is done. I need to start to =
think about the financial future of my kids.=
