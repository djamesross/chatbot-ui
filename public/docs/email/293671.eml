Ms. Boyce,

I am writing to confirm that you did, in fact, receive my treatment plan,
that you have a copy of the email that you sent indicating you were
satisfied with my financial disclosure when we met in your office last year
while I was suffering addiction, and that you did, in fact, receive details
about my car accidents but have failed to address my questions as to
why redundant details are necessary at this point.

I have also asked you to clarify where it says ongoing treatment plans are
required to be provided to you while *acknowledging *that I have
voluntarily collected all recent medical documents and will be sending them
as soon as the doctors make them available. (I have confirmation of two for
this week, the remainder to follow as soon as possible). I believe it is
reasonable for your client to feel confident, however, she was told in May
by CAS that there are to be no more restrictions. She was the first to
offer a sleepover. We reached shared custody. It was not until her parents
returned and I moved, initiating a change to child support we agreed to and
you submitted in court on both our behalf and my child care was no longer
needed that she provided the first reason. She then provided another
reason. She then withheld the girls entirely from me for more than two
weeks without justification or cause and has since restricted my access to
below what it was immediately after leaving the hospital and well after she
was told there are no restrictions required.

I have tried to reason with her, but neither you nor she has taken this
matter seriously, while the girls have and are, and are showing signs of
distress. This is not a battle between two adults, but about two young
girls.

Finally, I trust you have informed your client that she has raised no
safety concerned, although she does have a history of making false
accusations, and therefore has no grounds for this extreme restriction. In
fact, she refuses contact with me, shows no interest in how I seem, act, or
in my comportment, and nor do her parents. Clearly, this is punitive and I
will be seeking to make up time and redress if she does not agree to a very
quick return to the progress we achieved last summer, which I believed to
be in good faith.

She has refused offers of meditation, discussion, and continues to dictate
time, place and supervisor, contrary to the court orders. Nor does she
inform me of the girl's well-being or address my emails after she has
written to me. Since she waivers between telling me only to through you or
continues to withhold the girls until I do exactly what she demands, I will
maintain my communication with you.

I was going to apologize for asking for your availability before being
fully ready, and before recent events, before I realized you said you asked
for mine but never followed up. Is this going to be another case where she
settles at the last minute? It appears threatening and unfounded, given the
level of cooperation demonstrated over the summer and the amount of time I
spend with the girls, and their wishes.

Because of her decisions and failure to act she has caused me significant
financial hardship, which I will be seeking redress for, along with court
costs, however minimal they may be.

I cannot access my most recent tax filing but will do so Monday when CRA is
open, and send three most recent pay statements.

Even given that lack of information, this is not grounds or justification
for the position your client is taking, and it is demonstrably against the
girl's best interests.

Finally, note your client is dictating when, where, and with whom, without
regard to my job or responsibilities, which is contrary to the orders.

I am only accepting these visits because it is the only way I can see my
daughters and they can see me. There is no need for a supervisor or to
control how we interact. I received this email shortly after 1:10 and she
has told me I have to meet them at 2. n the past she has stated if I can't
make it I simply lose time because her parent's hobbies are the priority. I
trust you will advise her not to maintain this position any longer, given
there is no justification for refusing me access and then imposing
supervisors based on her own subjective feelings.

I will email her to let her now I can meet at 3 pm at the earliest, given I
am preparing exams, marking and it is the end of the term.

Darryl
