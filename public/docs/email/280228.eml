Charlotte and Alice did end up speaking to you yesterday Darryl. I
convinced Alice to have a quick chat and Charlotte said a quick hi while
she was on the couch lying down.

I am not actively withholding access. She has been bed ridden for two days
vomiting 8-10 times and I have been providing around the clock care while
taking care of Ali.

Charlotte is receiving an IV right now for fluids and resting. I will have
to monitor for rest of the day to make sure it=E2=80=99s not an appendiciti=
s. She
will FaceTime later today.

As for Ali she will join Charlotte to visit you when she is feeling better.

Cynthia
