Hi Any,

You may get an email or call from Dana Tapak (or her husband Al). They =
are my sister=E2=80=99s fiancee=E2=80=99s family, and are having legal =
problems with Al=E2=80=99s ex-wife. Dana actually works at Algonquin, =
and Al is a firefighter. I don=E2=80=99t know all of the details, but =
from what I've heard Al=E2=80=99s ex is a very difficult person. She=E2=80=
=99s refusing to settle (on what, I=E2=80=99m not exactly sure), and =
intends to take him to court (on what grounds, or for what, I=E2=80=99m =
not exactly sure). I do know, from what I=E2=80=99ve seen, that they are =
both great people, and Dana in particular has worked extremely hard to =
support Al=E2=80=99s sons.

Needless to say I strongly encouraged them to contact you.

I=E2=80=99ll follow up with them in a day or two to see where they=E2=80=99=
re at.
