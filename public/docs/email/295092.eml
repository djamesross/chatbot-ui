I'm only going to agree to tomorrow if you agree that it's only for dance, a=
nd only for Char. For tomorrow, I will pick them both up at 9 am. Assuming y=
ou agree, you can pick Char up in time for dance. If not, then I'll make alt=
ernate arrangements for the future.=20

I was going to let you know and make arrangements in a reasonable timeframe (=
i.e., some time this morning). Please keep in mind that the expectations you=
 have of me go both ways, and I would ask you do the same (notify, contact i=
f sick, etc.).=20
