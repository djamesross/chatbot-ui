Check out these texts from Cyn to me:

* Cynthia Holmes  - 2:29:47 PM

 - Thanks hun. These terrible feelings from my own past are coming up, =
plus feelings of terrible guilt mistreating you. It's a lot and i'm just =
figuring some of it out.

* Cynthia Holmes  - 12:38:35 PM


 - Ya, it is hard. I have nothing urgent which makes it worse. I'm just =
trying to keep some of these hard feelings and dark memories at bay.

* Cynthia Holmes  - 2:33:31 PM

 - Voicing it for the first time I can't believe I went thru it. It =
sounds like a movie to me.=20

* Cynthia Holmes  - 11:54:57 AM

 - Hi hun, thanks for the talk. I'm going to explore and work through my =
reaction to your audio request [I want to get a stereo - an interest =
I=E2=80=99ve long had, which was dismissed by Cyn]. I hear what you are =
saying and i'm trying to figure out why I'm blocking you. It helps to =
understand your feelings and why you are not feeling valued.

* Cynthia Holmes  - 9:14:58 AM

 - Waitng now, Ben opened about a lot of his worries and we talked. =
Thanks for pushing this at Wednesday's session. I do think we need to =
focus on "filling" him up right now. I've been so focused on being =
consistent and following through which is terrible important and needed =
but more emphasive needs to be put on Ben feeling good about himself. =
Anyways, I'm sure the psychologist will have some guidance as well as =
Dr. James.

* Cynthia Holmes  - 9:21:01 AM

 - PS I would like to put Ali down tonight [I=E2=80=99ve been putting =
her down almost every night, and she=E2=80=99s acting strange around =
Cyn], i'm sure some of her melt downs have been bc of what happening, =
she's not feeling safe. I know this is incredibly stressful for you too. =
Take care of yourself today hun. Xo=
