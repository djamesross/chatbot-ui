The girls have really taken to the fish, and look forward to feeding and car=
ing for them.=20

A ball python (or we might get a corn snake), are the best beginner snakes. I=
 would encourage you to google them to  find out more. I'll send a picture o=
f our set up, so you can see they'd precautions I'm taking. Keep in mind dog=
s can bite, and Calvin scratched and bit Ali several times, but we wouldn't d=
eny a cat or dog.=20

The girls wanted you to see pictures of our fish, too.=20
