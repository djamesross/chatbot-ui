Darryl,

Please follow up with my lawyer as she has clearly stated my concerns in two=
 letters.  We are still waiting to hear from you on the requested documentat=
ion and your court availability.

As for today=E2=80=99s visit, let=E2=80=99s make it Ken Ross Park. My stepda=
d isn=E2=80=99t familiar with Walter Bakker area and not abled body to be ou=
tside the car for that long.
