They were asleep by 7:45 last night, and slept 12 hours.=20

As for baths, I barely see them. Ali, I spend the day with; Char, barely =
see 10 hours a week. Two days without baths is not going to harm them in =
any way. But I will make one night a bath night.=20

We need to look into this tired thing, because they always complain of =
being tired. Your house and mine. I hope we can do that together. Kids =
often complain of being tired when they are stressed or other things are =
upsetting them. (Tummy aches too - that's almost always worries.)

And they need both, of us 50% of the time. Right now they are uncertain =
and confused and we can provide structure. I'm doing what I can to meet =
your demands so we can move forward. It's a slow process to get records =
and consent t share, but it will show I'm the dad they always had.=20

Finally, I think I left my keys with the bike lock in Char=E2=80=99s =
bag. That makes me feel very uncomfortable. Can you please leave them =
out and I=E2=80=99ll pick them up later tonight.

school night and that they bathe at least every other night.
