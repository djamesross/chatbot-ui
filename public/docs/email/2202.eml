Hi,
I feel more comfortable communicating about this subject about the boys as =
I'm worried about your reaction.=C2=A0The reason I don't want you to spend =
more time =C2=A0with the boys is I'm concerned for the boys' emotional well=
 being. You don't treat Ben well, you constantly criticize his actions and =
behaviour, you compare him to Sam which incredible hard for both the childr=
en and you blame him for your fights. If Ben responds negatively you lash o=
ut in anger. This has damaging=C2=A0effects on both children. Ben suffers f=
rom low self esteem, anxiety and depression, I want him to get better, I kn=
ow you do too. Sam also is incredibly anxious and has a hard time expressin=
g his feelings and blocks things that are hard to handle.
I don't think you mean to hurt the boys, I think this is the way you know h=
ow to parent. I know that you love the boys deeply, I see that. I do hope y=
ou can get some help managing your own feelings and that we can work=C2=A0t=
ogether on this but for now I think the current=C2=A0arrangement is all I'm=
 comfortable with.
