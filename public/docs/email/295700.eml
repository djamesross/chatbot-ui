Hi Cynthia,

As stated in our texts and emails:
- you made two conditions: the girls return to your house for the =
evening, and I refrain from drinking alcohol. I met both conditions.
- in your email you explicitly stated you would pick the girls up. They =
were ready and waiting at the door from 6:30 on.

That was all that was asked, and I met those conditions.=20

I can forward the texts and emails if you didn=E2=80=99t keep copies of =
them.

I was also hopeful that we could move forward, and hope that we still =
can.

Darryl
