Hello,

I'm following up on the incident that occurred last Friday to find out =
if there has been any further discussion. Charlotte raised a few =
concerns with me both Friday and again last night so I wanted to find =
out how or if the matter has been addressed.=20

I was concerned that what happened was described as a coup =C3=A0 la =
t=C3=AAte when Charlotte was punched in the back of the head as she was =
walking away, without warning. It was a serious incident that caused her =
significant pain and she is still not feeling herself yet. She suffered =
a concussion in August and she=E2=80=99s still feeling symptoms =
consistent with a minor concussion so I want to make sure that all of =
her teachers are aware that she is still sensitive to loud noises and =
bright lights, and should only take part in activities like sports and =
signing to the extent she is comfortable. She knows her limits but she =
may not be comfortable asking for a break or reduced activity, so I want =
to make sure her teachers are aware.

The incident was also a very scary and upsetting incident and has shaken =
her. She said she was crying afterwards and didn=E2=80=99t feel that it =
was understood how much it hurt or scared her. I think this is why she =
says she was surprised that the boy, at the time, was only given a brief =
verbal warning not to hit again. We talked about what would make her =
feel better and she said she doesn=E2=80=99t want further punishment or =
to make the matter more serious, but she does want to make sure that he =
knows how serious it was and how much more serious it could have been, =
and that hitting anyone is unacceptable under any circumstances and that =
there will be consequences if it happens in the future.=20

I spoke to her earlier in the semester about the school values and =
position on bullying and I want to make sure that physical violence is =
treated appropriately and seriously. Because she was punched from behind =
and without warning she was unable to anticipate the blow or to stiffen =
her neck and body, increasing the risk of injury and concussion. It =
would also be very scary and I don=E2=80=99t think she feels completely =
comfortable again yet.

Please let me know if there has been any further discussion and that her =
teachers are aware she may need reduced activity for a few more days.

Thank you,

Darryl
