Not as long as you are withholding the girls from me and breaking our =
parenting agreement.

Last we spoke, your mom was going to bring Alice to the school at 3:30 =
tomorrow. I will be at the school tomorrow at 3:30 to pick up both =
girls.

After consulting with Any I have collected all of the documents =
supporting our parenting agreement, and if you interfere with their time =
with me I will call the police and ask them to enforce our parenting =
agreement.

If you do not interfere I will consider talking on Thursday, but only =
after I=E2=80=99ve consulted with Any.=20
