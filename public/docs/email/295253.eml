I will. It would have been completely avoidable, once again, to avoid as you=
r first step the most extreme one available. You sent me this at 4 pm. I jus=
t got the girls out of the water, and am they are warming up. We can avoid t=
he dramatic scene and police involvement if you would agree to a reasonable a=
mount of time to pack up, bring them home, collect their things, and then tr=
eat it as a normal transition. Can we agree that would be better for the gir=
ls? I can do all of that by 6:30, and therefore avoid a traumatic and emotio=
nal scene.=20

So unless you planned this timing for maximum effect and you intent was to m=
anufacture this situation, I will have them ready for 6:30 and we can have a=
 smooth transition.=20

Please let me know as soon as possible.=20
