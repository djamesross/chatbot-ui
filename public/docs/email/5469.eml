Hello,

I am still waiting for a response to the very serious concerns I raised. =
Time is critical. I am moving at the end of the month and the girls are =
fully expecting to be living with me half the time. They were shocked to =
find out about your custody plan and how little they would see me. As of =
September 1st the payments through FRO will have to stop, and I will pay =
you the agreed amount directly. This is necessary because I am moving to =
place where I can include the girls, and my rent will be higher. This is =
exactly as we discussed and agreed too.

You have refused to have a conversation with me, and issues I have =
raised. The least you can do is respond because this has created anxiety =
and uncertainty for all of us, and time is critical.
