Dear Ms. Boyce,

I am writing to request that you review our correspondence to confirm
receipt of the treatment plan I sent to you last year, to clarify exactly
what documents you suggest are required in reference to your previous
letter regarding my past substance abuse, and confirm receipt of the
relevant details of the accident I caused in 2017, and why further details
are required and relevant to the current situation.

I was under the belief that all of the financial information I shared with
you and your client in your office last year was sufficient based on your
response. However, unable to afford representation for that meeting I will
be providing updated financial information shortly.

In the meantime your client is continuing to withhold my daughters from me
without cause, and is in breech of the last standing order. It is clear
that none of the reasons cited justify her position and the restriction of
my daughters rights to shared custody with me. The limitations and
restrictions she has placed on my ability to parent my daughters is
extreme. Shortly I will have complete documentation covering more than a
year of progress from each health care provider that I have worked with,
including Dr. Willows. CAS closed the case, stating explicitly that there
are no restrictions recommended. No safety concerns have been raised since.
Your letter describing the situation in which your client unnecessarily
involved the police is clearly inaccurate, and this response is punitive.

This situation has put undue stress on our daughters, and is quite the
opposite of their best interest. I have consulted Dr. Francis Harrison who
suggested mediation, which I am open to if necessary.

Regardless the process, there are no grounds for this situation and it is
not in your client's interest to continue. I look forward to establishing a
reasonable custody and access schedule, and begin to transition by week's
end.

Darryl
