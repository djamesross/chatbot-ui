Hi Any,

I wanted to fill you in more on my conversation with Heather, and find =
out if you=E2=80=99ve talked to Alison.

Cynthia sent me an email accusing me of breaking our agreement Sunday =
evening, which is completely false. I haven=E2=80=99t responded - I=E2=80=99=
ll wait to hear from you. Clearly she=E2=80=99s not going to agree to =
more unsupervised time.

I=E2=80=99m free the rest of the afternoon.

Darryl
