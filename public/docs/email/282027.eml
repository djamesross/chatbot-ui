I'm concerned because of what has happened: the hit and run, refusal for a
drug test, DUI (all right before you are to pick up the girls) and
neglecting the girls all day in your care (you were not sober and alert but
completely out of it). Plus an additional car accident in December and a
bike accident with the girls, strange calls to my mother and school
mother's friend, repeated lates to school, the list continues. This points
to a drinking problem while on a high dose of medication.

All of this is concerning but most of all its scary because you deny
anything is wrong. Can you not see why I would be concerned, Darryl? I
really think it's in the best interest of the girls to have both of us care
for them, but e both need to be healthy.

 This morning I smelt alcohol when you were close, most likely from the
night before. Were you drinking last night?

Would you be willing to take drug and alcohol tests?
