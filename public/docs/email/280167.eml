Hi Darryl,

The practice takes place at 7:30 pm at Half Moon Bay Park, which is at
Cambrian and Greenbank. She will need to be there no later than 7:20 pm.
She knows to bring her bag and to leave no later than 650 om.

As for this weekend, I am ok with a longer visit on Sunday, I can drop off
at your house at 10 am.

I am speaking with my legal counsel later today and will get back to you if
needed.

Cynthia
