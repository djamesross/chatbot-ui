Hi Cynthia,

I appreciate that you shared that screen shot with me today. Thank you.

Are you willing to share with me the reason why the girls missed school =
while you were away, and the time missed this week?

If you are willing to share any other information I would greatly =
appreciate it, including who cares for them while they are experiencing =
separation anxiety while you are on vacation, at work, etc., as well as =
any other health concerns, extra curricular activities, etc.

I believe you have made matters of decision making and parenting time =
concerns for the court to decided, or to be discussed with Ms. Boyce, =
and Ms. Boyce was explicit about your conditions.

Thank you,

Darryl Ross
