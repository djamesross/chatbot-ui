Hi Any,

I met with my therapist today (who is a clinical psychologist). She told =
me about her conversation with Heather. Dr. Milstone was quite forceful, =
and apparently Heather admitted to having been  =E2=80=98taken in=E2=80=99=
 by Cynthia=E2=80=99s stories. Dr. Milstone pushed her to talk to Sharon =
and Dr. James (a past family therapist), to make clear that Cynthia made =
this up, and did the same to Scott, the boy=E2=80=99s dad  (That=E2=80=99s=
 off the record, of course).

In regard to the email Cynthia sent my aunt=E2=80=99s last Friday, she =
asked that they deem me an unfit parent, and she asked my Aunt Kathy =
(who lives near the city) to sign an affidavit to that affect, or she =
would have to make an emergency motion to the courts for custody. Bt  =
she also told them that her and her parents can=E2=80=99t do anything on =
their own. She said they need one of my family members to make a case, =
or she wouldn=E2=80=99t be able to do anything.

Today she sent me and my sister the following message:

=E2=80=9CHi Darryl Are you living at home right now? Are you receiving =
treatment?=E2=80=9D

I didn=E2=80=99t respond.=20

She=E2=80=99s kept Charlotte home all this week because she has the flu. =
She says she took her to the doctor=E2=80=99s, but I=E2=80=99m thinking =
I might check. Either way, I plan on picking up Alice tomorrow, even if =
she=E2=80=99s keeping Charlotte home.

I also spoke to Will briefly, and the crown, as part of the plea is =
going to accept my version of the events (a medication mix-up), on the =
record. That should further weaken her case.

So my plan is, even if she keeps Charlotte home, is to pick Alice up in =
the afternoon and keep her until Friday afternoon, following our =
parenting agreement. And then to show up each time it=E2=80=99s my time =
with the girls. I can=E2=80=99t hide anymore, and won=E2=80=99t let the =
girls think that Cynthia makes the rules.

Have you heard anything?
