And to clarify - I do not accept what you are calling the status quo. A
status quo did develop over the summer, and I dropped them off according to
our agreement, which led you to refuse access, cease communication, and all
without a safety concern. You changed the status quo, and in Consentino vs
Consentnio 2016 the Chief Justice was clear: 'in any contest between the
best interest of the child' and 'fait accompli' - best interests will
always prevail. The only thing you have done to help me is given me ample
time to collect, organize and document the events, texts, emails, and every
other relevant detail. I am only cooperating because I'm the only parent
who won't use the kids or cause them unnecessary stress right now and
because you're not following court orders or joint custody. Case in point:
extracurricular activities. I realized it was more important to get over my
addiction, but you have carried on as though it's your sole decision. In
fact, you stated that it was and continues to do be, and have committed the
girls to each activity without any prior consultation. That was one reason
you informed me I would rarely see them, though more than now. Then you
changed their activities again without consolutation and came up with a new
reason for withholding the girls. You are illegally and against our
agreement withholding the girls from me. We either make this work together,
which we can and have done, with basic civility, or we leave it up to a
judge who may or may not meet Charlotte and Alice, and has precious time
yet will decide our future.

So no, you've attempted a fait accompli, and we'll see if you and your
lawyer actually follow through this time. But I have to move ahead because
you and you're entire family don't seem to notice, ask about, or pay
attention to the girls' best interests and what they want.

By the way, what is the name of the musical theatre group and when is the
recital?

I can be at Centrepointe for 2:30.0
