Hi Darryl,

I just received the schedule a few days ago and informed you when I found
out. Again I had emailed you more than 6 weeks ago informing you that this
change would be coming.I also respected your Sunday visits and has
Charlotte miss Spring training on Sunday with her team for a smoother
transition.

That=E2=80=99s very disappointing that you and Holly are not able to suppor=
t
Charlotte=E2=80=99s soccer practice this week. As I noted, she  has been mi=
ssing
her Sundays practices for 8 weeks to accommodate your Sunday visits. I
emailed this to you. May I add I have incurred all these costs to the girls
activities.

I know Charlotte's eager to start practicing with her team regularly and
wants to continue visit you and Holly at your home as well. I am unclear as
to why your mother is unable to drive the girls a bit earlier Tuesday and
extend Sunday=E2=80=99s visit by another generous two hours. Especially whe=
n Holly
was able to be earlier on Sundays before.

I receive schedule on team snap and have communicated to you their official
schedule with practice and game times.

I will be seeking further legal counsel tomorrow on this issue.

Best,

Cynthia
