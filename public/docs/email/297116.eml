Hi Any,

Sorry to bug you on the weekend - I don=E2=80=99t need an immediate =
response. I just want to run an email by you that I=E2=80=99d like to =
send to Cynthia. I want to address the issue with her, to tell her =
directly that I did not molest Charlotte or Alice. As long as it =
doesn=E2=80=99t hurt the case, I really need to say that to her. But I =
also want to put some more pressure on her, and let her know that I am =
fighting this, and will take this to court.=20

Let me know if you see any problems with the email, or if it could hurt =
our case.

Cynthia,

I=E2=80=99ve been told to remain silent on this issue - on the =
allegations that you=E2=80=99ve made against me. But I can=E2=80=99t. I =
have to address them. I was shocked and sickened to find out that you =
are accusing me of molesting Charlotte. To be called a pedophile, and an =
incestuous pedophile, by my own wife, is heartbreaking. There has been a =
lot of hard feelings between us the past few months, but there are still =
years in our past of good times, of love, of friendship, of caring. So =
to be accused of such horrible acts truly hurts. To have to even imagine =
them, is truly sickening.

I don=E2=80=99t know which is harder for me to accept - that you believe =
these allegations, or that you have made them up. But one of those must =
be true, because they are false. I have never molested or bitten or =
inappropriately touched either of our daughters.=20

I have been working as hard as I can to show that the allegations are =
false. When I found out that you made a police report I immediately went =
to the station to request a copy. When I found out that you called CAS I =
contacted Heather and immediately made an appointment. When I found out =
that you took Charlotte to CHEO for a physical exam, I was there, =
reading the report, two hours later. I found the nurse that admitted =
Charlotte, and she helped me to understand the chart and what was =
written. I=E2=80=99m chasing down every lead I can because I know that =
there is no evidence, no proof, and no reason to believe that I would =
hurt my children.

These are truly horrible allegations. Monstrous, even. And they hurt me. =
But what I=E2=80=99m more worried about is how they will affect =
Charlotte and Alice. What if she hears about these - through a family =
member, someone in the community, or some other way? What if, when =
she=E2=80=99s a teenager, someone says =E2=80=98hey, isn=E2=80=99t that =
the girl who=E2=80=99s father molested her?=E2=80=99 Rumours like that =
don=E2=80=99t need truth to hurt, and would be terrible for a teenage =
girl - or a girl of any age. If anyone believes even part of this story, =
it could mean no playdates at my house, it could create tension at =
school, and it could affect my career.=20

I am truly sorry that our marriage is ending. There was a lot of good in =
it, and it brought me happiness. But while our marriage is ending, our =
relationship is not, it=E2=80=99s just changing. Our relationship is now =
as the parents of Charlotte and Alice. And that relationship needs to =
work - the better it is, the better it is for our girls, and for all of =
us.=20

We should be working on our new relationship, so that we can support the =
girls. But first I have to address the allegations that you have made =
against me, and prove them false. As long as they stand, and limit my =
access to the girls, we are going to court. When allegations this =
important, this horrible, are raised, they have to be dealt with. That =
day will come soon, in court, but for now I needed to address them with =
you.
