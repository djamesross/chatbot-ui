Hi Darryl,

I previously agreed extending the Sunday visit to 1-7 pm and that is firm,
thanks.

Also I spoke to my lawyer Monday about your email to my mother about drop
off and also your concerns about Tuesday=E2=80=99s visit to the clinic, I a=
m
requesting you go through your lawyer on your concerns who can advise you
and if needed, reach out to Alison B when necessary.


Going forward, please do not email my mother.

Cynthia
