 Maybe this question is more specific. In 2017 Master Fortier ordered that =
&quot;The parties shall continue to have joint custody...&quot;, and &quot;=
on an interim and without prejudice basis, until furher agreement of the pa=
rties or Order of the court, the father.... shall have interim supervised a=
ccess three times per week on a schedule that is mutually agreed upon by th=
e parties, subject to a mutually agreeable supervisor being available.&quot=

ass=3DMsoNormal>The order from Master Champain from Jam.2018 again orders t=

 written agree by the parties or further Order of the Court.&quot;</p></div=

 about how supervisors are to be chosen and times decided on the principle =
of agreeableness, which was agreed upon by us (even though they knew I was =
experiencing active addiction but I know that train has passed), the order =
states nothing more about the changes to access to mu daughters save that t=
