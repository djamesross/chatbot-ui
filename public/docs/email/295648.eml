Sorry for being out of touch - with the strike, packing up this place, =
and looking for a new place (the one I thought was great may fall =
through), it=E2=80=99s been a hectic time.

We can do three times, or two times that are longer (that was Lynda=E2=80=99=
s suggestion). Let=E2=80=99s think about it and see what works best.

I=E2=80=99ll talk to Todd and Cindy and find a time they can commit to.

For Halloween, what are you thinking? I=E2=80=99d love to take them, and =
want to be there for at least part of the  time. Do you want to all go =
together, or split the time, or I can take them and you can take the =
boys (who have a much faster pace!).
