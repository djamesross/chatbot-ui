Cynthia,

I understand that you have been depressed, stressed, and struggling in our =
relationship recently. However, the girls should never have been taken from=
 our home, or from me. There is no basis for your actions. I have a right t=
o see them, and I would like to pick them up from school  tomorrow and keep=
 them for the night. While they are at school tomorrow we can discuss a tem=
porary schedule for visitation.

You can let me know what you need for the night and for tomorrow and I will=
 pack it for you and leave it inside or outside of the house. I will also p=
ack a bag for the girls, and include anything the boys need. However, it is=
 not acceptable to remove any additional belongings.

My lawyer has made it clear to me that you are not acting legally, and she =
will be in contact tomorrow. If  you don't return the girls we will be init=
iating a movement with the court. If you would like to speak to her sooner =
I can provider her number.

Once you have told me what you need I will pack it and leave it in a conven=
ient spot.

Darryl
