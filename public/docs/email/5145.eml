Hi Cynthia,

I can't make 3-4, and that's not what the girls and I talked about. We're
dancing around the real topic here, it seems you don't want me to know
where either of my daughters will be. With soccer you were explicit, this
time it would be easier to be simply be honest if that is the case, and I
don't kow that it is, only that it fits the pattern. If that's the case it
would be easier to say so. What little I see them, I request you do not
interfere with. And would you kindly try to work out a time where the girls
and I are available, rather than booking me without regard for anything I
may have to do. They really were excited about it.

Regards,

Darryl
