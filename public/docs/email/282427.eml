I think for now as the weather gets colder and you are moving, that two
visits a week would work well. I would really appreciate starting setting a
schedule asap with Todd and Cindy as I like to plan out the rest of my
weekend. I try to schedule things the Wednesday or Thursday so please let
me know if they can commit to an afternoon on the weekend.

As for Hallowe'en, you are welcome to take them out around my place close
by. I think 45 mins to an hour is plenty of time weather dependent. They
will be ready for *6 pm.*

I was hoping you could switch out the candy you give the girls every visit
to something less junky, like fruit or a granola bar or stickers. I'm doing
my best to limit their sugar and would appreciate the support.


See you tmrw.
