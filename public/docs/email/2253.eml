So I would definitely not follow someone else=E2=80=99s idea 100% but =
definitely use some of it.  I think you guys have to show that you both =
love each other like crazy, but have your differences.  Ale, you know =
that when you have to fill out form for Alex and do stuff he =
won=E2=80=99t or can=E2=80=99t do, it pisses you off.   Alex had things =
he doesn=E2=80=99t like about you.  You need to feed on these things and =
show both passion for each other as well as show that you have a spark =
that could ignite into flames.  Think about what the producers are =
looking for.  They want the audience to see a connection but also that  =
there are complications.  Like any good soap-popper.  (sorry.  Not sure =
of the spelling!) . So, you need to show a mix of compatibility while =
showing them the potential for conflict.

Finally, the people at the Amazing Race, have gotten you guys pretty =
far.  Don=E2=80=99t give up on all of the things you have done in the =
past.  They were successful.  I would use the things from the past =
videos that you felt were successful.  Or perhaps redo them.  =
Don=E2=80=99t imitate 100% what others have done.  Be partially =
original, partially take from what you have done in the past, and =
partially from what other have done.

Good luck!

Hi guys!!!

So tomorrow is our 10 year wedding anniversary and we thought we'd spend =
it making our season 5 application video....

Every year we get one step further to getting on the show and this is =
OUR year!!! lol

Most of you have seen our previous videos but we thought this year we =
would take out all the special side effects and just show us =
interacting....

I want to put a bunch of questions in a jar and pull questions and then =
answer them....

Kind of like the following video:

=20

http://theamazingracecanada.ctv.ca/Video?videoid=3D900643

=20

=20

So i was just wondering if you guys have any questions you think we =
should ask... something that will make us interact... I have some in =
mind:

=20

*	Who is more competitive?
*	Who is more likely to have a melt down first? (we ALL know the answer =
to this one lol)
*	What is your biggest pet peeve of Alex/Allie?
*	Who is the better dancer (pretty sure we ALL know this answer too)
*	Who wins in an argument?
*	Who would be more excited to get into the amazing race?

=20

Anyhow just thought id put this out there in case anyone has some great =
questions we should ask!!!

Have a great weekend everyone!!!=20

Allie
