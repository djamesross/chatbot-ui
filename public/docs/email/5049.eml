Hey,

So I=E2=80=99m actually really in the dark about what is happening. I have b=
een on leave since late October, and I have not been paid since October. I w=
as told the EAP pays for short term leave and will contact me, with no numbe=
r given. I haven=E2=80=99t heard from them yet, and haven=E2=80=99t been abl=
e to reach anyone in HR for more details, though messages have been left. I d=
o know I get pay, but exactly how much and when I haven=E2=80=99t been told.=
 I=E2=80=99m really going to bug them today and may even  have to go in.=20

You=E2=80=99ll be the first to know when I find out.=20

I plan to return in, at most, two weeks. But again, that depends on whether o=
r not there is a certain length of time I need to take to get paid for short=
 term leave. That would be the only reason to take more time.=20

As for the FRO papers, I can=E2=80=99t submit them until I know I have regul=
ar pay again, or else they may bounce. But once I have regular pay I will im=
mediately submit the papers and let you know. Until then and as soon as I re=
ceive pay I will email transfer the money.=20

On a separate topic, have you had a chance to talk to Krystle? I met with he=
r at her office yesterday morning, and she said she=E2=80=99d call you right=
 after we finished, just after noon.=20

Darryl=20

Hi Cynthia,<br>
<br>
I apologize for not being in touch sooner, but I was unable to be for medica=
l reasons. <br>
<br>
I want to assure you that I have every intention of paying support, and catc=
hing up. Since I=E2=80=99ve been off work I haven=E2=80=99t received pay. I h=
ad to submit paperwork which I was only able to do a few days ago. So when m=
y pay comes through I will be sure to send what I can to you, and then make s=
ure I=E2=80=99m up to date as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
