Cynthia,

I am concerned with this sudden change that has occured, which has =
almost completely cut off all access and communication between me and =
our daughters. I was hoping that taking some time and space would bring =
some perspective. I=E2=80=99m asking for a justification or explanation, =
that we return to regular visits on an agreeable schedule, until we can =
agree to a permanent schedule or until such time as one is mandated, but =
primarily an attempt to work this out in a way that affects the girls as =
little as possible.=20

We had been, cooperatively and explicitly, with Krystale=E2=80=99s help, =
explaining to the girls that as my health improved they would be able to =
count on seeing me regularly, and more often. And my health has =
improved. And our visits extended and the girls were happy I have had no =
problems since, and the girls came to count on that. Since I last =
dropped the girls off to you, in August, for swimming lessons, my =
ability to see them, spend time with them, and even to have a =
relationship with them, has been completely restricted. But more =
importantly, and what I thought we could finally really agree on, is =
their best interests. I don=E2=80=99t understand how this could benefit =
the girls in any way, and I=E2=80=99m asking for an explanation. Without =
one, I can only assume you felt there was a serious safety concern to =
warrant this restriction, but none has been raised, and so I ask you to =
share your concerns and justification. I have been in touch with CAS, =
and have not had contact with Ottawa Police since the night they =
visited, at which time they raised no safety concerns. In fact they =
refused to come in when I offered, saying they saw no need. So again, I =
ask that you please share your concerns with me.

More importantly, and presently, this restriction brakes the terms of a =
standing court order, the last issued by the court. That order is very =
clear: I am to visit with the girls three times per week at an agreed =
upon time. We are, after working cooperatively with CAS, well beyond the =
need for supervision, and have made significant progress beyond that, =
until the present period, and current restriction. There continues to be =
no basis for reversing all of that progress. Placing such an extreme =
restriction on my right to custody and access not only sets us back, but =
is in breech of a standing court order.

I want to see my daughters, regularly and frequently, with a schedule =
that is mutually agreeable, and takes school and extra-curricular =
activities into account. I=E2=80=99m asking for communication and an =
attempt to do so. Or alternative approaches to solving this. But in the =
meantime, I see no reason for this restriction, and just want to see the =
girls.=20

Please send me a proposed schedule by tomorrow at 5 pm, and I will =
respond, so that we can start top work out a schedule that allows =
Charlotte and Alice and me reasonable time to spend together given the =
progress we have made.

I really hope that we can work this out quickly and in the best =
interests of the girls.

Darryl
