Hi Darryl.

I am not agreeable to this solution.

My mom  is no longer  comfortable driving for long distances in the winter,
in the dark at her age. I am not comfortable with her driving as well
=E2=80=94which then puts the driving on me. During tour visit time with the=
 girls ,
I=E2=80=99m normally working or taking care of myself.

I do understand Holly=E2=80=99s situation  and want to try to resolve this.

As you know you currently do not pay any child support, section 7 expenses
 or the many years in arrears in child support.

I think it=E2=80=99s completely reasonable for me  to request you pay for a
driver/driving service for the girls for their safe transport home.

Alternatively can you start looking into a place that you can afford that
is walking distance from our home or at least in Barrhaven?

I will be speaking to my lawyer this week and seeking some advice and
guidance on this matter and I will be in touch.

As it stands now my mom will drop them off for noon and Holly can drop them
off at the end of the visit at my home.

Cynthia

<br>
The forecast is calling for as much as 100 cm of snow between about 3 pm an=
d 8 pm which is too much for my mom to drive tonight on highways and countr=
y roads. The local roads will likely be bad too. She is available Wednesday=
 or Thursday.<br>
<br>
If the local roads are drivable I propose they be dropped off and picked up=
 this evening as usual. Visits have been supervised for 1.5 years now and I=
 think it=E2=80=99s time to move to unsupervised visits based on the record=
 of the last 18 months of perfect visits. (For comparison, in 2018 followin=
g the direction of CAS they started after one month, so it=E2=80=99s been 1=
8x longer). If they are bad, I propose starting unsupervised visits Wednesd=
ay or Thursday as alternatives.<br>
<br>
Please let me know:<br>
- if you are agreeable to moving to unsupervised visits at this time (or by=
 the end of this month, January, 2024)<br>
- which evening works best: Wednesday or Thursday<br>
