 I'm not really clear on what all this means - can we chat for a few minutes=
?=20

I can call you tonight or tomorrow if you have a few minutes.

The last message I got from Cynthia said that she wanted work it out togethe=
r, but this sounds like she's not. To be blunt, she does not accept that she=
 owed me child support and I believe she will fight the equalization, even i=
f it makes it worse for both of us.=20

I'm not sure where she's at, but I am doing much better, and hope that helps=
.
