Without prejudice,

As always supervision and the restriction you came up with is unnecessary,
all of which interferes with my ability to parent my daughters and
interferes with their ability and need to develop their own relationship
with me, and I am in complete opposition, I will agree to meet at 4:30.

However, they are always hungry when I see them. Would dinner at IKEA be so
unreasonably to you under the circumstances and given them time?

And underdressed. It's cold out now.
