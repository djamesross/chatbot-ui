Hello Darryl:

Thank you for responding to my query about the piano lessons and piano. It =
sounds like things continue to be difficult for you, which I am sorry to he=
ar.

I am not clear on  the whereabouts of the piano the Society rented?  Am I u=
nderstanding the piano rental is at Cynthia=92s home? Or at your own? As I =
indicated the Society cannot pay for further lessons, and I have been asked=
 to facilitate the return of the piano. Please confirm the whereabouts and =
if I should be contacting Cynthia directly.

Sincerely,

Jennifer

Hi Jennifer,

I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but it's been very difficult.

I was very happy to hear that the girls would be starting lessons again aft=
er stopping intermittent lessons, and was happy to switch days with Cynthia=
 to facilitate it. However, from what I understand they have not had a less=
on since we made arrangements at the start of November. Charlotte told me t=
hat their teacher is preparing for a recital and cannot see them Wednesdays=
, which is the day we switched too in order for them to restart lessons. Th=
ough she's not really sure, and Cynthia will not talk to me.

Just by chance, there is a keyboard where I'm currently living and there is=
 a very mature 13 year old who knows how to play it who would be happy to t=
each the girls once or twice a week. consistently. I would love to make arr=
angements to make that work, but the girls are not allowed here without Cyn=
thia being present supervising. If we find some way of mediating things so =
the girls could benefit I think that would be great. But given my financial=
 situation, and the fact that though we have joint custody Cynthia never in=
forms me of extracurricular activities or costs, I'm just not in a position=
 to afford it. There also happens to be a drum set, microphones, and other =
musical instruments, which the girls were very interested in the one time t=
hey have been allowed here. But Cynthia remains insistent on supervising, a=
nd the family is not comfortable with that. They think it's good for the gi=
rls for their mom to drop the off, see their room, and so on, but not to su=
pervise.

So unfortunately I can't help with the costs going forward, especially when=
 they were never consistent and there is a free and positive alternative.

If you have any ideas on how this could work, or would like to talk further=
 about it, I can be reached at 613-762-2067. In the meantime I try to enjoy=
 the 3.5-4 hours a week she will allow me to see them supervised at locatio=
ns of choice;

I do hope you are enjoying your holidays, and wish you happy new year.

Darryl

 never informs me of extracurricular activities or costs, I'm just not in a=
 position to afford it. There also happens to be a drum set, microphones, a=
nd other musical instruments, which the girls were very interested in the o=
ne time they have been allowed here.
 But Cynthia remains insistent on supervising, and the family is not comfor=
table with that. They think it's good for the girls for their mom to drop t=
he off, see their room, and so on, but not to supervise.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>So unfortunately I can't help with the costs going forward, especially=
 when they were never consistent and there is a free and positive alternati=
ve.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If you have any ideas on how this could work, or would like to talk fu=
rther about it, I can be reached at 613-762-2067. In the meantime I try to =
enjoy the 3.5-4 hours a week she will allow me to see them supervised at lo=
cations of choice;<br>

<div>I do hope you are enjoying your holidays, and wish you happy new year.=
