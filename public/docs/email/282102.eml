Hi Darryl,

Thanks for the response. I am not interested in speaking with you about
finances until you get treatment and detox. I'm hopeful that will bring you
some peace and clarity. If you change your mind about supporting the girls
right now, please let me know.

As I said awhile back I have contact the Canadian Child Tax Benefit to
advise them that our shared custody has changed to girls living with me
full time as of August 1st, 2017.

You will need to confirm this information to them ASAP. I'm not sure if you
have, if you haven't and are still collecting CCTB it will need to be paid
back so it's best to reach them quickly to avoid owing alot of $$. You can
contact them at 1-800-387-1193 and speak to an agent by pressing *.

Please let me know when you have spoken to them.
