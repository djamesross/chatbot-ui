Hi,

That works, but my mom and I are going to the noon show, so we could =
bring the girls back here from the theatre. I=E2=80=99ll make sure Char =
gets to relax and has a good meal.

I=E2=80=99m not sure how much you have to do Saturday, but I=E2=80=99m =
around and would love some one on one time with Ali. There are a few =
things we=E2=80=99ve been working on (a huge marble run set, for one), =
and it would be fun to do together.

Darryl

I can pick up a C at your place for the second show ( like 430) and then =
pick up Alice after the show ( like 730?). Does that work.
