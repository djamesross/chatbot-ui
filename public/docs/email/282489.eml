Hi Darryl,

I checked the calendar and I have the girls that weekend. I can volunteer
for the second show when the girls are with you and give you a ride home if
needed. Just let me know of the arrangements.

The second payment for the costumes are due. Can you please send me $50.00
ASAP? Thanks!

together to showcase all of their hard work and dedication! We take great
pride in our end-of-year performances.

Your dancers work very hard though the year and we want their time on stage
to be successful and uplifting. With this in mind, please remember
that *attendance
in classes going forward is a huge part of ensuring success and confidence
come show-time.*

COSTUMES: your dancers costumes will be arriving the *week of May 8th 2017*.
