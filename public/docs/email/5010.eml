The snake is mine. So are the fish. Char and Ali are too young to be =
fully responsible for pets. But while I chose them and care for them, =
they=E2=80=99ve both shown an interest in helping, love to feed the =
fish, and are very curious about Sarah (the snake).

As for Sarah, ball pythons are very safe pets. They are docile, almost =
never bite, and if they do, it causes far less damage than a cat (Ali =
was scratched and bitten by Calvin several times), or a dog, which have =
large teeth and strong jaws, and cause a lot of injuries each year.=20

You know how much I love dogs and cats, and I may eventually get one, or =
several, but they are far more of a risk than a ball python.

=E2=80=98Python' might sound scary, but the reason they=E2=80=99re =
called =E2=80=98ball' pythons is because they curl into a ball when =
scared or threatened, and would rather hide than hurt. The girls know =
that they are never to open the cage (same with the fish lid). Only =
I=E2=80=99m allowed to do that. But, as a precaution, to make you feel =
better, I will get something to make sure they can=E2=80=99t open the =
lid (there are locks and alarms used for snakes that are actually =
dangerous, and I will look into them and let you know which I chose).

And Sarah is nothing like a reticulated python or even a boa =
constrictor. Those snakes can grow well beyond 8-10 feet, and could be a =
risk, which is why I would never buy one. And venomous snakes are not =
legal, but I=E2=80=99d never get one of those either. Sarah won=E2=80=99t =
get longer than 4-5 feet, at most, and will never be able to hurt either =
of the girls, beyond a bite, which as I=E2=80=99ve said is more rare and =
less serious than a cat or dog bite.

I was bitten by dogs when I was younger, several times. We had a =
border-Collie mix  that bit when people wrestled, and ran in front of my =
bike and caused some terrible road rash (scraping gravel out of my =
wrists hurt. A lot. As for the bites, sometimes they caused a bruise, a =
few times I bled. I=E2=80=99ve been scratched by cats. I was also bitten =
by a snake, but it caused no bruising or bleeding. It would be scary, =
but cannot do anywhere near the damage a large dog could do.
=20
So, the snake is contained, I=E2=80=99ll ensure the lid can=E2=80=99t be =
opened by the girls (which is just common sense). it  can't constrict =
children, and will never get big enough to pose a danger, even if it =
wanted too. There is a risk with all pets, but ball pythons are very low =
on that list - certainly lower than cats or dogs.=20

I hope that makes you feel better, and that you can appreciate that the =
girls are learning about animals, how to care them, and why it=E2=80=99s =
important to respect what different animals need. For instance, the fish =
need light and dark, water changes, and don=E2=80=99t ever want to be =
held; while Sarah needs much of the same, but less water, of course, and =
only rarely wants to be touched or held.

As for your concerns about my =E2=80=98behaviour=E2=80=99, the list of =
accusations you=E2=80=99ve made against me is so long, and has been =
growing continuously over the last 15 months, so it=E2=80=99s hard to =
take them seriously.

Nevertheless, here are a few responses::
- I can assure you that I never left a piece of glass on Char=E2=80=99s =
pillow One did fall on it, she noticed it, but I pulled her bed apart =
and vacuumed the entire area, and would have done so whether she would =
have noticed it or not. The only time she=E2=80=99s been cut by broken =
glass was on Holland ave, when I wasn=E2=80=99t home. And when I got I =
home I found and vacuumed up the rest of the pieces of glass that were =
left on the floor.
- The girls are asleep by 7:30, often earlier. They sleep through the =
night. By =E2=80=98late=E2=80=99, they mean 8 pm, (8:30 at the latest, =
if it=E2=80=99s a weekend). I don=E2=80=99t mind letting them play games =
on my phone on occasion, and I=E2=80=99m happy to lie back and relax =
while they do. But that doesn=E2=80=99t happen very often.
- The girls always complain about being tired when they first come here, =
and you=E2=80=99re on record with Sharon stating that Char has trouble =
sleeping, which shocked me because they sleeps  well here. They=E2=80=99ve=
 both told me about being woken up by fighting and yelling. Knowing how =
important sleep is for learning, growth, and emotional development, and =
after talking to Dr. Doulgass (my sleep doctor and head of the sleep =
clinic at the Royal), I chose to let them sleep in several times as we =
transitioned from Christmas break.
- I was late picking them up twice. My apologies. It might happen once =
in a while in the future, too. But you surely you remember being an hour =
or more late picking up the girls up during the summer. On several =
occasions. (If not, check your texts and emails.) But is this really an =
issue that affects the girls=E2=80=99 well-being, and one we need to =
make an issue of? I don=E2=80=99t think so.

In the meantime let=E2=80=99s get things settled: we need a detailed =
parenting agreement, a financial settlement, and to officially divorce, =
now that it=E2=80=99s been a year.
