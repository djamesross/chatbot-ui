email to dr. james:

I need some advice/help!

Saturday morning Cynthia took the girls to see their cousins. She texted =
me in the afternoon to say she will be keeping them for the night their =
because of the situation between us. I asked her not to, and to please =
bring them home. She replied: =20

=E2=80=9CI no longer feel safe with you and I no longer feel that the =
children are safe with you. I will not let you see them them right now. =
I understand this is distressing and I hope you can get some help=E2=80=9D=


Later, she wrote:

=E2=80=9CI feel that the kids are not safe with you Darryl. I=E2=80=99m =
their mother and my NUMBER one job to make sure my kids are safe. This =
is the issue we both need to face. You need to face this Darryl and I =
want you to get help. You will be able to see the girls at some point by =
not now=E2=80=9D

I=E2=80=99m am worried about all of them - Cynthia is not well. =
Something is wrong! She left me all summer with the kids - I have all =
the texts - all day. Four kids - and I was depressed and seeing a =
psychiatrist! He has since cleared me (Dr. Alan Douglass at the ROH), =
and says I=E2=80=99m doing very well and am no longer showing signs of =
depression. And now she takes the kids now. Something is wrong with her =
judgement.=20

We had a plan to reintegrate Ben. You helped us make it. Well Ben walked =
in Friday after school, and neither of us were expecting it. He looked =
scared to see me! He asked where his mom was, and she was out running =
errands. I tried to reassure him, but it=E2=80=99s not the same coming =
from me alone. He called her on speaker phone and at one point she says =
=E2=80=98is Darryl there?=E2=80=99 Ben says ya. She says =E2=80=98are =
you ok=E2=80=99. Ben says ya. And that was it (I have the recording). =
Her reason for removing Ben was to protect him, because of her mamma =
bear instincts, but left him to walk into an empty house with me and no =
preparation. Sam also looked confused when he later walked in.

There is so much more Dr. James. All of the times she says she was =
scared of me are recorded and I am not acting in a way that a =
psychologically healthy person would call scary. But she feels scared, =
she=E2=80=99s taken the children, and it seems like she=E2=80=99s made =
this about her mothering. She is acting very irrationally, and not in =
the best interests of the kids.

I didn=E2=80=99t know it Thursday at our appointment, but she was making =
a plan. She sat with you and I acknowledging it was a mistake to take =
the boys, and said she wouldn=E2=80=99t do it again. She told you she =
had absolutely no concern for the kids safety - that I would never hurt =
them. She left me to take care of the girls that morning and afternoon =
alone. She left both boys to walk into the house from school to face me =
with no warning or preparation - she wasn=E2=80=99t even home. I =
didn=E2=80=99t find out until later that Thursday night she =E2=80=98needs=
 time to make a plan, because Darryl won=E2=80=99t accept this=E2=80=A6 =
lawyers will get involved=E2=80=99 (direct quote). So while she was =
sitting with you and I, she was already planning to take them, and the =
reason was because she was so scared of me.

I=E2=80=99ve spoken to two police officers, one form the domestic crimes =
unit, and there is nothing they can do. But both of them looked at the =
correspondence and were suspicious of what she was saying. In their =
words she was using =E2=80=98boiler-plate=E2=80=99 phrases and buzz =
words. They said that in their experience that=E2=80=99s not how a =
person who is really afraid communicates or acts. Both of them advised =
me to seek legal help immediately.

I=E2=80=99m tired of telling people to keep an open mind, and just =
consider both sides. Cynthia is not well. I am and have always been the =
main parent for the girls. I am their secure-base, their attachment, and =
they will be increasingly distressed without me. Cynthia has lost a lot =
of weight, is pale, recently increased her medication dosage, and is not =
acting in the best interests of the children. She=E2=80=99s making =
erratic decisions and unfounded accusations. And now she has the kids.

I need help.=20
