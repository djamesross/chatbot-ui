Hi Cynthia,

Thank-you for your reply. I appreciate the communication and am glad =
that you asked. Several weeks ago I had a relapse and accepted that I =
was dealing with a problem that I could not solve on my own. I admitted =
myself to the Perth & Smith Falls Hospital for treatment. They tested me =
from COVID and everything else imaginable, which was all negative, and =
then detoxed me medically, before discharging me. At the hospital I met =
with the local social worker, and with the Hospital doctor and Dr. =
Brenhouse, we have agreed on a few treatment plans, none of which is =
better than another, but depends on what Algonquin will cover, which =
I=E2=80=99m waiting to hear about. For this week I am staying at my =
Mom=E2=80=99s, and working with the local social worker, and have an =
appointment with Dr. Brenhouse. Next week I will return to my =
aparrtment, and will be connected with the social worker for Barrhaven =
(Ottawa), and transition from working with Chris, the social worker from =
this area, to the social worker for my area. If possible, I am going to =
spend at least 30 days in a private in-patient centre. If not, I am on =
the waiting list for an OHIP covered treatment centre, I have an intake =
appointment booked for the beginning of June, and will see a counsellor =
and doctor Brenhouse regularly until a spot opens up. I am sober and =
committed to remaining so. As I have promised, I will not call the girls =
and refuse to visit them if I do relapse. But with the support I now =
have I am committed to remaining healthy, sober, and able to maintain a =
regular, responsible, and reliable relationship with Charlotte and =
Alice.

While working with Chris, we discussed how I should explain my abscence =
to them. I won=E2=80=99t lie or hide this from them. I am going to use =
familiar language, that I had the same illness I had in the past, taking =
to much =E2=80=98bad medicine=E2=80=99, called alcohol, and keeping it =
simple, true and age appropriate, that I went to the hospital where the =
doctors and nurses treated me and helped me to get healthy again, and =
checked me for everything including my heart and liver, COVID, MRSA, and =
everything else, and asked me to stay until the alcohol was out of my  =
system, and I didn=E2=80=99t need of the medication they use to make me =
better, and was healthy enough to return to my mom=E2=80=99s and even =
start biking again. That I missed them everyday and thought of them all =
the time, and called as soon as I was able too. So, honest, but =
age-appropriate. I am also going to tell them that a symptom of this =
illness is relapse (in simpler words), and that I am getting all the =
support I can, and am committed to staying heelthy, but that if I do =
have a relapse they don=E2=80=99t need to worry, and they are still the =
most important people to me, but if that happens I will have to go back =
to the hospital for help where the doctors and nurses know just what to =
do to help me get healthy again. I want them to know I am not absent =
because I=E2=80=99m busy, or happy doing something else, but sick and =
getting healthy so I can be their dad which is and always has been the =
best part of my life. Then I=E2=80=99m going ask about their feelings, =
if they have questions, or fears. After that, I want to ask them what =
they=E2=80=99ve been up to, and follow their lead. I love listening them =
talk about what they=E2=80=99re doing, thinking about, or hoping for.

Their is nothing good about developing an addiction. But I do get to =
tell them about my experience, in different ways as they grow up, and =
hopefully they will understand the importance of abstinence, which is my =
choice, or responsible drinking, which is their choice when they are old =
enough. For all the pain it=E2=80=99s caused, and for all the regret I =
have felt, I do I get to tell them my story and use it in a positive way =
for our girls. I don=E2=80=99t want to lecture you, or them,  but I put =
a link at the bottom that you can read if you want to. It=E2=80=99s to =
The National Association for Children of Alcoholics, and The Recovery =
Village, both of which were recommended to me to look at.=20

And I miss them terribly, and I think about them every moment of =
everyday. Please let me know how they have been doing with school, which =
I will be catching up on and contacting when I return to my apartment, =
their health, and in general, especially given the restrictions given =
COVID. I would also, in the interest of the girls and communication, =
like to know what you feel you need to prepare them for, and what you =
plan to say to them. They have told me in the past a number of things =
that are either not true or not accurate, such as I have a contagious =
illness. Given their age, it=E2=80=99s too easy to jump to conclusion =
about what you are saying or doing, am I am sure the reverse is true, =
which is why we need to communicate at some level. Communicating is not =
for us, but is necessary for them.

On another matter, I will be contacting FRO Tuesday to begin making =
payments again, starting this week, and set up a way to catch up for the =
missed payments over the coming months. Hopefully in no more than 6 =
months, before returning to regular payments.

I hope you and the boys are well, and look forward to talking to the =
girls over FaceTime or Duo. I can chat anytime tomorrow.

Darryl
