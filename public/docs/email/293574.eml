Hi Darryl.

I did not comment on OCL involvement.

Camp is the same as last year, I already gave it to you the dates. August
6-11.

 I am allowed to take a summer vacation with the girls, that=E2=80=99s is a=
 normal
family  activity. It will be in July and a duration less than 2 weeks. I am
waiting for a flight sale for Saskatoon and will let you know.

Right now soccer is :

Charlotte
Monday nights 730-830 and one more additional time ( waiting on it).

Ali
Wednesday 6-7
Saturday 8-9 am
Sunday noon - 1 pm
