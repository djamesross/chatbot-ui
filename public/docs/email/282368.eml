Hi Darryl,


The girls had a good weekend. They spent some time with Jessie on Saturday
and we went on a few nature walks on Sunday. They are tired today from all
the activity. The girls are with mum all week.


I=E2=80=99m filing my 2016 return now and the official helping me advised t=
hat we need
written proof for CRA that we agree to appoint our daughters as dependents
(you for Charlotte and me for Alice) and that we have not exchanged child
support.



I drafted two copies of the letter and will drop it off after work today,
can you please sign both copies and keep one for your files. I will need
this back by Wednesday morning at the latest. Please include your SIN. If
you have any questions, just e-mail me.





I have spoken to Heather Clark and she agrees that the two visits a week
are a good start for the girls. She also supports that my parents are
supervising the visits. It=E2=80=99s easier on the girls to just have you t=
here.



I have connected with Angie and I'm trying to set up a visit with the girls
and her in the next few weeks. I feel it=E2=80=99s important that they stay=
 in
contact with your side of the family and I want to keep communicating with
everyone.



I=E2=80=99m glad you are able to talk with Dennis, we all care for you and =
want to
support you and do hope you get the help you need to be healthy again.







Take care,



Cynthia
