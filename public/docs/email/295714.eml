Confidential and no-prejudicial

Hi Cynthia,

I desperately want to see the girls, but as you know I gave notice and =
am moving tomorrow.=20

As we both know, there is no need for supervision and I disagree with =
this restriction to my access. However, I am available Sunday and will =
see them however I can, if I can, and I will be in Barrhaven from =
Saturday evening on.

Please ask the girls to call me this evening.

Darryl
